    "|**Advantage**|Interpreters are easier to use, especially for beginners.|The program code is already translated into machine code. Thus, it code execution time is less.|\n",
    "|**Disadvantage**|Interpreted programs can run on computers that have the corresponding interpreter.|You can't change the program without going back to the source code.|\n",
    "|**Machine code**|Not saving machine code at all.|Store machine language as machine code on the disk.|\n",
    "|**Running time**|Interpreters usually take less amount of time to analyze the source code. However, the overall execution time is comparatively slower than compilers.|Compilers usually take a large amount of time to analyze the source code. However, the overall execution time is comparatively faster than interpreters.|\n",
    "|**Model**|It is based on interpretation method.|It is based on language translation linking-loading model.|\n",
    "|**Program generation**|Do not generate output program. So they evaluate the source program at every time during execution.|Generates output program (in the form of .exe) which can be run independently from the original program.|\n",

In such cases, interpreters are better.|Bounded to the specific target machine and cannot be ported. C and C++ are a most popular a programming language which uses compilation model.|\n",
    "|**Code Optimization**|Interpreters see code line by line, and thus optimizations are not as robust as compilers.|The compiler sees the entire code upfront. Hence, they perform lots of optimizations that make code run faster.|\n",
