    "# Backpropagation\n",
    "\n",
    "We got a brief explaination of what a Neural network is, now let's understand how such networks are trained.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s start by understanding how neural networks *learn* through something called **Backpropagation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the heart of AI, backpropagation is an important algorithm that helps a neural network learn from its mistakes and get better at making predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine teaching a student by telling them how close their answers are to the correct one, and then giving them feedback to improve their next guess. This is exactly what backpropagation does!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why do we need it ?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A neural network is like a series of math equations. It takes an input (like an image of a dog), runs some calculations, and then produces an output (like saying whether it’s a dog or a cat). **But the first time the network makes a guess**, it’s usually not very accurate. \n",
    "\n",
    "Backpropagation helps the network learn from its mistake by adjusting its internal settings (called **weights** and **biases**) to improve the guess next time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s break this down step by step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Forward Propagation – Making a Guess**\n",
    "   - Imagine you’re solving a math problem: You take the input (numbers), do some calculations, and come up with an answer.\n",
    "   - In a neural network, the input is passed through layers, where each layer applies some math (a weighted sum + activation) to get a result.\n",
    "   - This result is compared to the correct answer (the true label), and we calculate how *wrong* the network’s guess was. This is called the **loss** or **error**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Error – How Far Off Was the Guess?**\n",
    "   - The error tells us how bad the guess was. Now, we need to figure out which parts of the network are responsible for that error.\n",
    "   - But instead of saying “You’re wrong!” to the network, we give it specific feedback, like “This part of your guess needs fixing more than that part.”\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Backward Propagation – Learning from the Mistake**\n",
    "   - This is where **derivatives** come in! Remember from high school calculus, a derivative tells you **how much one thing changes in response to another**. For example, the derivative of distance with respect to time gives you speed (how fast distance changes as time changes).\n",
    "   - In backpropagation, we’re asking: **\"How much does the error change when we change the weights and biases?**\"\n",
    "   - Using the **chain rule** from calculus, we calculate how changing each weight in the network would affect the error. Think of it like tracing your mistake backward through each math step.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Derivatives and Gradients – Finding What to Fix**\n",
    "   - The derivative we calculated tells us how much each weight contributed to the error. This gives us a **gradient**—a direction to move in to reduce the error.\n",
    "   - Imagine you’re hiking in the mountains and want to reach the lowest point (the error’s minimum). The gradient points you in the direction of the steepest slope downward, telling you which way to go to reduce the error the fastest.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Updating Weights – Fixing the Mistake**\n",
    "   - Once we know which weights are responsible for the error, we adjust them slightly in the opposite direction (down the slope) to reduce the error. This process is called **gradient descent**.\n",
    "   - The size of these adjustments is controlled by a **learning rate**—if the steps are too big, we might overshoot; if too small, learning is slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Repetition – Practice Makes Perfect**\n",
    "   - This process of guessing (forward propagation), learning from mistakes (backpropagation), and updating weights continues for many cycles. Over time, the network’s guesses improve, and the error gets smaller and smaller."

    "So, in summary, the learning process is simply adjusting the weights and biases that's it! The Neural Netowork does this by a process called Backpropagation. The steps are as follows:\n",
    "1. Randomly **initialise weights**\n",
    "2. __Forward Pass__: Predict a value using an activation function. \n",
    "3. See how bad you're performing using loss function (compare predicted value with actual value). \n",
    "4. __Backward Pass__: Backpropagate the error. That is, tell your network that it's wrong, and also tell what direction it's supposed to go in order to reduce the error. This step updates the weights (here's where the network learns!)\n",
    "5. Repeat steps 2 & 3 until the error is reasonably small or for a specified number of iterations. \n",

    "Step 3 is the most important step. We'll mathematically derive the equation for updating the values. \n"

We can not assign zero to all thetas since this would make our network useless because every neuron of the layer will learn the same as its siblings. In other word we need to **break the symmetry**. In order to do so we need to initialize thetas to some small random initial values:\n",
