    "**Artificial neural networks** (ANN) or connectionist systems are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains.\n",
    "\n",
    "The neural network itself isn't an algorithm, but rather a **framework** for many different machine learning algorithms to work together and process complex data inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such systems \"learn\" to perform tasks by considering examples, generally without being programmed with any task-specific rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ">For example, in **image recognition**, they might learn to identify images that contain cats by analyzing example images that have been manually labeled as \"cat\" or \"no cat\" and using the results to identify cats in other images.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> They do this without any prior knowledge about cats, e.g., that they have fur, tails, whiskers and cat-like faces. Instead, they automatically generate identifying characteristics from the learning material that they process.\n",
    "\n",
    "An ANN is based on a collection of connected units or nodes called **artificial neurons**, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each connection, like the synapses in a biological brain, can transmit a signal from one artificial neuron to another. An artificial neuron that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional artificial neurons connected to it.\n",

    "![Artificial Neuron](https://s.mriquestions.com/uploads/3/4/5/7/34572113/perceptron-with-neuron_1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In common ANN implementations, the signal at a connection between artificial neurons is a real number, and the output of each artificial neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The connections between artificial neurons are called **edges**.Artificial neurons and edges typically have a **weight** that adjusts as learning proceeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection. Artificial neurons may have a threshold such that the signal is only sent if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, artificial neurons are aggregated into layers. Different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first layer (the **input layer**), to the last layer (the **output layer**), possibly after traversing the **inner layers** multiple times.\n",

    "\n",
    "A **multilayer perceptron (MLP)** is a class of feedforward artificial neural network. An MLP consists of, at least, three layers of nodes: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. an input layer, \n",
    "   \n",
    "2. a hidden layer and \n",
    "   \n",
    "3. an output layer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Except for the input nodes, each node is a neuron that uses a nonlinear activation function. \n",
    "\n",
    "MLP utilizes a supervised learning technique called backpropagation for training. \n",
    "\n",
    "Its multiple layers and non-linear activation distinguish MLP from a linear perceptron. \n",
    "\n",
    "It can distinguish data that is not linearly separable."
