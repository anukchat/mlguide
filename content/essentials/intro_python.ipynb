    "# Getting Started with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "With Python you can do pretty much anything, you can automate every task. Its simpler to learn and use than any other language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python also offers much more error checking than C, and, being a very-high-level language, it has high-level data types built in, such as flexible arrays and dictionaries. Because of its more general data types Python is applicable to a much larger problem domain than Awk or even Perl, yet many things are at least as easy in Python as in those languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python allows you to split your program into modules that can be reused in other Python programs. It comes with a large collection of standard modules that you can use as the basis of your programs — or as examples to start learning to program in Python. Some of these modules provide things like file I/O, system calls, sockets, and even interfaces to graphical user interface toolkits like Tk.\n",
    "Python is an interpreted language, which can save you considerable time during program development because no compilation and linking is necessary. \n",
    "\n",
    "The interpreter can be used interactively, which makes it easy to experiment with features of the language, to write throw-away programs, or to test functions during bottom-up program development. It is also a handy desk calculator.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python Applications Area\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is known for its **general purpose** nature that makes it applicable in almost each domain of software development. Python as a whole can be used in any sphere of development. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we are **specifing applications** areas where python can be applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Web Applications**\n",
    "    - We can use Python to develop web applications. It provides libraries to handle internet protocols such as HTML and XML, JSON, Email processing, request, beautifulSoup, Feedparser etc. It also provides Frameworks such as Django, Pyramid, Flask etc to design and delelop web based applications. Some important developments are: PythonWikiEngines, Pocoo, PythonBlogSoftware etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **AI & Machine Learning** \n",
    "    - Python has Prebuilt Libraries like Numpy for scientific computation, Scipy for advanced computing and Pybrain for machine learning (Python Machine Learning) making it one of the best languages For AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Desktop GUI Applications**\n",
    "    - Python provides Tk GUI library to develop user interface in python based application. Some other useful toolkits wxWidgets, Kivy, pyqt that are useable on several platforms. The Kivy is popular for writing multitouch applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Software Development** \n",
    "    - Python is helpful for software development process. It works as a support language and can be used for build control and management, testing etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Scientific and Numeric** \n",
    "    - Python is popular and widely used in scientific and numeric computing. Some useful library and package are SciPy, Pandas, IPython etc. SciPy is group of packages of engineering, science and mathematics.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Business Applications** \n",
    "    - Python is used to build Bussiness applications like ERP and e-commerce systems. Tryton is a high level application platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Console Based Application** \n",
    "    - We can use Python to develop console based applications. For example: IPython.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Audio or Video based Applications** \n",
    "    - Python is awesome to perform multiple tasks and can be used to develop multimedia applications. Some of real applications are: TimPlayer, cplay etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **3D CAD Applications** \n",
    "    - To create CAD application Fandango is a real application which provides full features of CAD.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Enterprise Applications** \n",
    "    - Python can be used to create applications which can be used within an Enterprise or an Organization. Some real time applications are: OpenErp, Tryton, Picalo etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Applications for Images** \n",
    "    - Using Python several application can be developed for image. Applications developed are: VPython, Gogh, imgSeek etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **Games and 3D Graphics** \n",
    "    - PyGame, PyKyra are two frameworks for game-development with Python. Apart from these, we also get a variety of 3D-rendering libraries. If you’re one of those game-developers, you can check out PyWeek, a semi-annual game programming contest."
