<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">Write a concise summary of the following:</span>


<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">&quot;The winter glory of the Sierra ! How little is known of it! Californians admire descriptions of the Swiss Alps, reading with breathless interest how ice and snow load their sublime heights, and booming avalanches sweep in glorious array through their crowded forests, while our own icy, snow-laden mountains, with their unrivaled forests, loom unnoticed along our eastern horizon. True, only mountaineers may penetrate their snow-blocked fastnesses to behold them in all their white wild grandeur, but to every healthy man and woman, and even to children, many of the subalpine valleys and lake-basins, six or seven thousand feet above the sea, remain invitingly open and approachable all winter. With a friend and his two little sons I have just returned from a week of bracing weathering around Lake Tahoe, in which we enjoyed glorious views of winter, fine rolling and sliding in the snow, swimming in the icy lake, and lusty reviving exercise on snow-shoes that kept our pulses dancing right merrily. All the weather was hearty and exhilarating, though varying almost from hour to hour: snowing, blowing, clear and cloudy, but never rigorously cold.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">This winter has been remarkably mild, the mercury having seldom made a very near approach to zero, even during the coldest nights around the lake, while the average noonday temperature was considerably above the freezing- point. The snow lies deep on the surrounding mountains and about the shores, solid white contrasting with the dark-blue water of the lake, while the forests and canons and the upper glacial fountain hollows are well filled, assuring abundance of summer water for the lakes and streams.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">According to the record kept by Mr. McKinney, on the west shore of the lake, eight miles above Tahoe City, at an elevation of 6,500 feet above sea-level, the amount of snow, measured as it fell, was twenty-two feet and four inches for the season up to March 20th, with four inches of rain, while an inch or two more of rain and two or three feet of snow will probably fall before the full opening of spring. Last season the snowfall, measured by the same observer, at the same station, was only nine feet and seven inches, while the season before last it was no less than forty seven feet and six inches. The fall about Yosemite Valley, according to my own observations, usually considerably exceeded this. The greater portion of the snow that loads the main summits of the range falls in small crisp flakes and broken crystals; or when accompanied by strong winds at a low temperature, the crystals, instead of being locked together in tufted flakes, are driven against each other and broken into meal and fine dust which darkens the sky like night But down in the forested region, at about the elevation of Lake Tahoe, the greater portion comes gently to the ground, light and feathery, some of the flakes in mild weather being nearly an inch in diameter, and is evenly distributed and kept from drifting to any great extent by Lake Tahoe in Winter. 121 the shelter of the woods. Every tree is loaded with the fairy bloom, bending down the branches, and hushing the singing of the elastic needles. When the storm is over and the sun shines, the dazzling snow at once begins to settle and shift and fall off the trees in miniature avalanches; then the relieved branches spring up and shake themselves dry, and the whole green forest, fed and refreshed, waves and sings again rejoicing. The snow on the ground settles also, and thaws and freezes until it becomes coarsely granulated ice, with all trace of its crystalline snow structure destroyed. This is the present condition of most of the snow on the range. From towards midnight until midday at this time of year a man may walk firmly over the surface, as if on ice, provided the preceding day has been warm and the night frosty.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">The forested region up to an elevation of about eight thousand feet is generally clear of snow towards the end of May or middle of June; but now (March 28th) the higher canons are still heavily blocked, and the head tributaries of the rivers flow in dark tunnels beneath the icy mass. As warm summer advances, the roof of compacted snow falls in here and there, leaving magnificent arching bridges where it is strongest, over which one may safely ride a horse. All the upper streams are thus buried and bridged every winter, and are seldom completely opened to the light before the end of June or middle of July.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">Notwithstanding twenty-two feet of snow has fallen here this season, so greatly has it been melted and compacted, the present average depth at a height of 7,500 feet does not exceed seven feet. The drifts in exposed lake hollows and along the lee sides of bald ridges above the timberline are often fifty feet or more in depth, and many of the latter are grandly adorned with overcurling cornices, beneath which pale blue light shimmers with ineffable beauty. But it is in the fountain cirques of the ancient glaciers, beneath the shadows of the highest peaks, that the heaviest and most enduring deposits are stored up. For there the lavish snowfall on the steep converging slopes is shot down in avalanches during or after&#39; every storm, heaping snow on snow to a depth of a hundred feet, or even more at times. These treasured banks are never wholly melted, however hot the summer, but with the few lingering glaciers form perennial fountains for the highest tributaries of the rivers.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">Few even among Californians have any fair conception of the marvelous abundance of glacier lakes hidden in the fastnesses of our mountains. The snow and some of the glaciers make a telling show, even from the distant lowlands; but not a single stream is visible, nor a hollow where one might hope to find a lake. Nevertheless, wild rivers are falling and sounding in every canon, and all their upper branches are fairly laden with lakes like orchard-trees with fruit. They nestle in rocky nooks and hollows about all the high peaks and in the larger canons, reflecting their stern, rugged beauty and giving charming animation to the bleakest and most forbidding landscapes. From the summit of Red Mountain, a day&#39;s journey to the east of Yosemite Valley, forty-two may be seen within a radius of eight or ten miles. The whole number in the Sierra can hardly be less than fifteen hundred, exclusive of the smaller gems, which are innumerable. Perhaps two-thirds of them lie on the west flank of the range, and all are restricted to the alpine and subalpine regions, those which once brightened the lower regions having long since vanished by the filling in of their basins. Lake Tahoe is king of them all, not only in size, but in the surpassing beauty of its shores and waters. It seems a kind of heaven to which the dead lakes of the lowlands had come with their best beauty spiritualized. It lies embosomed in mountains of moderate height near the northern extremity of the high portion of the Lake Tahoe in Winter. 123 range, between the main axis and a spur that puts out on the east side from near the head of the Carson River. Though it is twenty-one miles long by ten wide, and from about five hundred to sixteen hundred feet deep, its basin was once occupied by a glacier which filled it from the bottom to a point high above the present water-level, and being lavishly fed by the snows of the encompassing mountains, crawled slowly, like a mighty river, over the north rim of the basin, crushing and grinding the lower mountains that lay in its way, and it was only at the end of the ice period that this noble lake, at least in anything like its present form, came into existence.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">Excepting the forests that have sprung up around its shores, the post-glacial changes that have taken place are scarcely appreciable. The sediments carried forward by the inflowing streams at the head of the lake have made a few square miles of meadow-land, and the breaking through of a moraine dam in the canon of the outlet has lowered the lake considerably, leaving shore benches and lines on the rocky promontories to mark the original level. With these comparatively unimportant exceptions, the lake itself and all its grandly sculptured, ice-scored, and moraine-streaked basin exist to-day in just about the condition they presented when first they came to the light towards the close of the Glacial Period.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">The destructive action of man in clearing away the forests has not as yet effected any very marked change in general views. Perhaps about 150,000,000 feet of lumber for the Comstock mines has thus far been cut from the lake shores. But the business is being pushed so fervently from year to year, almost the entire basin must be stripped ere long of one of its most attractive features. One of the lumber companies at work here has contracted with mine owners to supply 36,000,000 feet of lumber and 60,000 cords of wood this season. It is estimated that the Tahoe basin still contains about 600,000,000 feet of lumber available for the mines.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">In summer the woods resound with the outlandish noise of loggers and choppers and screaming mills; skiffs and steamboats skim the lovely blue water in work and play; and ever and anon as you thread the groves along shore you come upon groups of gay tourists sauntering about, gathering flowers, or resting luxuriously in the rosiny shade of the pines, some in easy picnic attire, others all ribbons and colors, glaring wildly amid the green leaves and frightening the wondering squirrels and birds. But winter brings rest. At sight of the first snowflake pleasure-seekers flee as from a plague, the ax leaves the woods, and the kind snow heals every scar. Contemplating the basin from any commanding hilltop, only pale curls of smoke seen at wide intervals betoken the existence of human dwellings. Like the bears, the few settlers that remain here are silently &quot;holed up.&quot; The snow covers their cabins as if they were bowlders, and when approached only a narrow shoveled-out passage, or tunnel, is found leading to the door. Some of the more enterprising winter dwellers drift about in boats in calm weather, catching trout for the Carson market,â€”for the lake, on account of its great depth, never freezes. They thus earn from thirty to forty dollars a month, and at the same time get rid of lonely dullness. A trapper may also be seen now and then shuffling along the shore on long Norwegian snow-shoes in pursuit of minks, fishers, and otters.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">In this letter I intended only to say a good word for winter in the mountains, hoping to incite others to come and enjoy it, sketching our excursion to illustrate the ease and comfort with which such snowy winter rambles may be made; but I have written too much I fear about the snow to leave room for more than a thin outline. We went by rail to Lake Tahoe in Winter. 125 Carson, and from there set out by stage for Glenbrook. After ascending on wheels until we reached the snow-line, the driver attached his four horses to a sled, hoping thus to cross the summit, which is less than eight thousand feet high, without much difficulty. But mild weather had softened the snow, and the unfortunate animals, after floundering and wallowing through a mile of it, lay down exhausted with their heels in the air. Then we made our way on foot over to the lake. Next day, on a small steam-tug, we crossed the lake to McKinney&#39;s, on the west shore, where we were at home. Here we spent a few health-giving, delightful days, rowing, bathing, racing at lightning speed on snow-shoes down a mountain-side back of the house, and slipping about through the solemn, silent woods. Only the eldest of my companions ventured with me on the steep slopes. This was his first experience on snowshoes, and the several descents he made were the most remarkable specimens of falling locomotion that I ever had the fortune to witness. In shooting down steep declivities the long sled-runner-like shoes have to be kept parallel with firmly braced limbs. My friend, however, heedless of advice, launched himself in wild abandon, bouncing and diving, his limbs and shoes in chaotic entanglement, now in the snow, now in the air, whirling over and over in giddy rolls and somersaults that would shame the most extravagant performances of a circus acrobat. How original and inimitable he was! Wonderfully refreshing and exhilarating his queer capers must have been; for on coming to rest, with his runaway members divorced and lost, he would quietly gather himself, pick out the snow from his neck and ears, and say with preternatural solemnity, &quot;This, Muir, is the very poetry of motion.&quot;</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">We also spent some rare evenings by the huge fire in McKinney&#39;s old cabin. The log walls are covered with trophies of the chase, for our host has been a great hunter in his day. Two live pet coons were frolicking on the floor while our grand old host smiled benignly and played with them, the firelight gleaming on his weathered face. How big he seems, thus brought into relief, and what a shadow he casts! The fragrant rosiny fire is the very god of the home. No wonder the old nations, with their fresher instincts, had their fireside gods. At last, when a mild snow-storm was blowing, we rowed to the lower end of the lake and completed our excursion by slipping on snow-shoes down the Truckee canon to the railroad.&quot;</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">Write a concise summary of the following:</span>


<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">&quot;February 2021Before college the two main things I worked on, outside of school,</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">were writing and programming. I didn&#39;t write essays. I wrote what</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">beginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">are: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot,</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">just characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">deep.The first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">school district used for what was then called &quot;data processing.&quot;</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">This was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district&#39;s</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">my friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">a mini Bond villain&#39;s lair down there, with all these alien-looking</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">machines  CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader  sitting up</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">on a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.The language we used was an early version of Fortran. You had to</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">type programs on punch cards, then stack them in the card reader</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">and press a button to load the program into memory and run it. The</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">result would ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">loud printer.I was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn&#39;t figure out what to do with</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">it. And in retrospect there&#39;s not much I could have done with it.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">The only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards,</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">and I didn&#39;t have any data stored on punched cards. The only other</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">option was to do things that didn&#39;t rely on any input, like calculate</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">approximations of pi, but I didn&#39;t know enough math to do anything</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">interesting of that type. So I&#39;m not surprised I can&#39;t remember any</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">programs I wrote, because they can&#39;t have done much. My clearest</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">memory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">to terminate, when one of mine didn&#39;t. On a machine without</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">time-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical error, as</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">the data center manager&#39;s expression made clear.With microcomputers, everything changed. Now you could have a</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">computer sitting right in front of you, on a desk, that could respond</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">to your keystrokes as it was running instead of just churning through</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">a stack of punch cards and then stopping.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">[1]The first of my friends to get a microcomputer built it himself.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">It was sold as a kit by Heathkit. I remember vividly how impressed</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">and envious I felt watching him sitting in front of it, typing</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">programs right into the computer.Computers were expensive in those days and it took me years of</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">nagging before I convinced my father to buy one, a TRS-80, in about</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">1980. The gold standard then was the Apple II, but a TRS-80 was</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">good enough. This was when I really started programming. I wrote</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">simple games, a program to predict how high my model rockets would</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">fly, and a word processor that my father used to write at least one</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">book. There was only room in memory for about 2 pages of text, so</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">he&#39;d write 2 pages at a time and then print them out, but it was a</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">lot better than a typewriter.Though I liked programming, I didn&#39;t plan to study it in college.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">In college I was going to study philosophy, which sounded much more</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">powerful. It seemed, to my naive high school self, to be the study</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">of the ultimate truths, compared to which the things studied in</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">other fields would be mere domain knowledge. What I discovered when</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">I got to college was that the other fields took up so much of the</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">space of ideas that there wasn&#39;t much left for these supposed</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">ultimate truths. All that seemed left for philosophy were edge cases</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">that people in other fields felt could safely be ignored.I couldn&#39;t have put this into words when I was 18. All I knew at</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">the time was that I kept taking philosophy courses and they kept</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">being boring. So I decided to switch to AI.AI was in the air in the mid 1980s, but there were two things</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">especially that made me want to work on it: a novel by Heinlein</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">called The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, which featured an intelligent</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">computer called Mike, and a PBS documentary that showed Terry</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">Winograd using SHRDLU. I haven&#39;t tried rereading The Moon is a Harsh</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">Mistress, so I don&#39;t know how well it has aged, but when I read it</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">I was drawn entirely into its world. It seemed only a matter of</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">time before we&#39;d have Mike, and when I saw Winograd using SHRDLU,</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">it seemed like that time would be a few years at most. All you had</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">to do was teach SHRDLU more words.There weren&#39;t any classes in AI at Cornell then, not even graduate</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">classes, so I started trying to teach myself. Which meant learning</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">Lisp, since in those days Lisp was regarded as the language of AI.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">The commonly used programming languages then were pretty primitive,</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">and programmers&#39; ideas correspondingly so. The default language at</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">Cornell was a Pascal-like language called PL/I, and the situation</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">was similar elsewhere. Learning Lisp expanded my concept of a program</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">so fast that it was years before I started to have a sense of where</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">the new limits were. This was more like it; this was what I had</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">expected college to do. It wasn&#39;t happening in a class, like it was</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">supposed to, but that was ok. For the next couple years I was on a</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">roll. I knew what I was going to do.For my undergraduate thesis, I reverse-engineered SHRDLU. My God</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">did I love working on that program. It was a pleasing bit of code,</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">but what made it even more exciting was my belief  hard to imagine</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">now, but not unique in 1985  that it was already climbing the</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">lower slopes of intelligence.I had gotten into a program at Cornell that didn&#39;t make you choose</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">a major. You could take whatever classes you liked, and choose</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">whatever you liked to put on your degree. I of course chose &quot;Artificial</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">Intelligence.&quot; When I got the actual physical diploma, I was dismayed</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">to find that the quotes had been included, which made them read as</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">scare-quotes. At the time this bothered me, but now it seems amusingly</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">accurate, for reasons I was about to discover.I applied to 3 grad schools: MIT and Yale, which were renowned for</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">AI at the time, and Harvard, which I&#39;d visited because Rich Draves</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">went there, and was also home to Bill Woods, who&#39;d invented the</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">type of parser I used in my SHRDLU clone. Only Harvard accepted me,</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">so that was where I went.I don&#39;t remember the moment it happened, or if there even was a</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">specific moment, but during the first year of grad school I realized</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">that AI, as practiced at the time, was a hoax. By which I mean the</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">sort of AI in which a program that&#39;s told &quot;the dog is sitting on</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">the chair&quot; translates this into some formal representation and adds</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">it to the list of things it knows.What these programs really showed was that there&#39;s a subset of</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">natural language that&#39;s a formal language. But a very proper subset.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">It was clear that there was an unbridgeable gap between what they</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">could do and actually understanding natural language. It was not,</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">in fact, simply a matter of teaching SHRDLU more words. That whole</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">way of doing AI, with explicit data structures representing concepts,</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">was not going to work. Its brokenness did, as so often happens,</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">generate a lot of opportunities to write papers about various</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">band-aids that could be applied to it, but it was never going to</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">get us Mike.So I looked around to see what I could salvage from the wreckage</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">of my plans, and there was Lisp. I knew from experience that Lisp</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">was interesting for its own sake and not just for its association</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">with AI, even though that was the main reason people cared about</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">it at the time. So I decided to focus on Lisp. In fact, I decided</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">to write a book about Lisp hacking. It&#39;s scary to think how little</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">I knew about Lisp hacking when I started writing that book. But</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">there&#39;s nothing like writing a book about something to help you</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">learn it. The book, On Lisp, wasn&#39;t published till 1993, but I wrote</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">much of it in grad school.Computer Science is an uneasy alliance between two halves, theory</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">and systems. The theory people prove things, and the systems people</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">build things. I wanted to build things. I had plenty of respect for</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">theory  indeed, a sneaking suspicion that it was the more admirable</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">of the two halves  but building things seemed so much more exciting.The problem with systems work, though, was that it didn&#39;t last.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">Any program you wrote today, no matter how good, would be obsolete</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">in a couple decades at best. People might mention your software in</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">footnotes, but no one would actually use it. And indeed, it would</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">seem very feeble work. Only people with a sense of the history of</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">the field would even realize that, in its time, it had been good.There were some surplus Xerox Dandelions floating around the computer</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">lab at one point. Anyone who wanted one to play around with could</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">have one. I was briefly tempted, but they were so slow by present</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">standards; what was the point? No one else wanted one either, so</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">off they went. That was what happened to systems work.I wanted not just to build things, but to build things that would</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">last.In this dissatisfied state I went in 1988 to visit Rich Draves at</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">CMU, where he was in grad school. One day I went to visit the</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">Carnegie Institute, where I&#39;d spent a lot of time as a kid. While</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">looking at a painting there I realized something that might seem</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">obvious, but was a big surprise to me. There, right on the wall,</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">was something you could make that would last. Paintings didn&#39;t</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">become obsolete. Some of the best ones were hundreds of years old.And moreover this was something you could make a living doing. Not</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">as easily as you could by writing software, of course, but I thought</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">if you were really industrious and lived really cheaply, it had to</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">be possible to make enough to survive. And as an artist you could</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">be truly independent. You wouldn&#39;t have a boss, or even need to get</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">research funding.I had always liked looking at paintings. Could I make them? I had</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">no idea. I&#39;d never imagined it was even possible. I knew intellectually</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">that people made art  that it didn&#39;t just appear spontaneously</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green"> but it was as if the people who made it were a different species.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">They either lived long ago or were mysterious geniuses doing strange</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">things in profiles in Life magazine. The idea of actually being</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">able to make art, to put that verb before that noun, seemed almost</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">miraculous.That fall I started taking art classes at Harvard. Grad students</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">could take classes in any department, and my advisor, Tom Cheatham,</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">was very easy going. If he even knew about the strange classes I</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">was taking, he never said anything.So now I was in a PhD program in computer science, yet planning to</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">be an artist, yet also genuinely in love with Lisp hacking and</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">working away at On Lisp. In other words, like many a grad student,</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">I was working energetically on multiple projects that were not my</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">thesis.I didn&#39;t see a way out of this situation. I didn&#39;t want to drop out</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">of grad school, but how else was I going to get out? I remember</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">when my friend Robert Morris got kicked out of Cornell for writing</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">the internet worm of 1988, I was envious that he&#39;d found such a</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">spectacular way to get out of grad school.Then one day in April 1990 a crack appeared in the wall. I ran into</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">professor Cheatham and he asked if I was far enough along to graduate</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">that June. I didn&#39;t have a word of my dissertation written, but in</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">what must have been the quickest bit of thinking in my life, I</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">decided to take a shot at writing one in the 5 weeks or so that</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">remained before the deadline, reusing parts of On Lisp where I</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">could, and I was able to respond, with no perceptible delay &quot;Yes,</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">I think so. I&#39;ll give you something to read in a few days.&quot;I picked applications of continuations as the topic. In retrospect</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">I should have written about macros and embedded languages. There&#39;s</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">a whole world there that&#39;s barely been explored. But all I wanted</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">was to get out of grad school, and my rapidly written dissertation</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">sufficed, just barely.Meanwhile I was applying to art schools. I applied to two: RISD in</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">the US, and the Accademia di Belli Arti in Florence, which, because</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">it was the oldest art school, I imagined would be good. RISD accepted</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">me, and I never heard back from the Accademia, so off to Providence</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">I went.I&#39;d applied for the BFA program at RISD, which meant in effect that</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">I had to go to college again. This was not as strange as it sounds,</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">because I was only 25, and art schools are full of people of different</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">ages. RISD counted me as a transfer sophomore and said I had to do</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">the foundation that summer. The foundation means the classes that</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">everyone has to take in fundamental subjects like drawing, color,</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">and design.Toward the end of the summer I got a big surprise: a letter from</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">the Accademia, which had been delayed because they&#39;d sent it to</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">Cambridge England instead of Cambridge Massachusetts, inviting me</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">to take the entrance exam in Florence that fall. This was now only</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">weeks away. My nice landlady let me leave my stuff in her attic. I</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">had some money saved from consulting work I&#39;d done in grad school;</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">there was probably enough to last a year if I lived cheaply. Now</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">all I had to do was learn Italian.Only stranieri (foreigners) had to take this entrance exam. In</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">retrospect it may well have been a way of excluding them, because</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">there were so many stranieri attracted by the idea of studying</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">art in Florence that the Italian students would otherwise have been</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">outnumbered. I was in decent shape at painting and drawing from the</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">RISD foundation that summer, but I still don&#39;t know how I managed</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">to pass the written exam. I remember that I answered the essay</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">question by writing about Cezanne, and that I cranked up the</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">intellectual level as high as I could to make the most of my limited</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">vocabulary.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">[2]I&#39;m only up to age 25 and already there are such conspicuous patterns.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">Here I was, yet again about to attend some august institution in</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">the hopes of learning about some prestigious subject, and yet again</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">about to be disappointed. The students and faculty in the painting</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">department at the Accademia were the nicest people you could imagine,</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">but they had long since arrived at an arrangement whereby the</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">students wouldn&#39;t require the faculty to teach anything, and in</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">return the faculty wouldn&#39;t require the students to learn anything.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">And at the same time all involved would adhere outwardly to the</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">conventions of a 19th century atelier. We actually had one of those</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">little stoves, fed with kindling, that you see in 19th century</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">studio paintings, and a nude model sitting as close to it as possible</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">without getting burned. Except hardly anyone else painted her besides</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">me. The rest of the students spent their time chatting or occasionally</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">trying to imitate things they&#39;d seen in American art magazines.Our model turned out to live just down the street from me. She made</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">a living from a combination of modelling and making fakes for a</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">local antique dealer. She&#39;d copy an obscure old painting out of a</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">book, and then he&#39;d take the copy and maltreat it to make it look</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">old.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">[3]While I was a student at the Accademia I started painting still</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">lives in my bedroom at night. These paintings were tiny, because</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">the room was, and because I painted them on leftover scraps of</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">canvas, which was all I could afford at the time. Painting still</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">lives is different from painting people, because the subject, as</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">its name suggests, can&#39;t move. People can&#39;t sit for more than about</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">15 minutes at a time, and when they do they don&#39;t sit very still.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">So the traditional m.o. for painting people is to know how to paint</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">a generic person, which you then modify to match the specific person</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">you&#39;re painting. Whereas a still life you can, if you want, copy</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">pixel by pixel from what you&#39;re seeing. You don&#39;t want to stop</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">there, of course, or you get merely photographic accuracy, and what</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">makes a still life interesting is that it&#39;s been through a head.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">You want to emphasize the visual cues that tell you, for example,</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">that the reason the color changes suddenly at a certain point is</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">that it&#39;s the edge of an object. By subtly emphasizing such things</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">you can make paintings that are more realistic than photographs not</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">just in some metaphorical sense, but in the strict information-theoretic</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">sense.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">[4]I liked painting still lives because I was curious about what I was</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">seeing. In everyday life, we aren&#39;t consciously aware of much we&#39;re</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">seeing. Most visual perception is handled by low-level processes</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">that merely tell your brain &quot;that&#39;s a water droplet&quot; without telling</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">you details like where the lightest and darkest points are, or</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">&quot;that&#39;s a bush&quot; without telling you the shape and position of every</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">leaf. This is a feature of brains, not a bug. In everyday life it</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">would be distracting to notice every leaf on every bush. But when</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">you have to paint something, you have to look more closely, and</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">when you do there&#39;s a lot to see. You can still be noticing new</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">things after days of trying to paint something people usually take</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">for granted, just as you can  after</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">days of trying to write an essay about something people usually</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">take for granted.This is not the only way to paint. I&#39;m not 100% sure it&#39;s even a</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">good way to paint. But it seemed a good enough bet to be worth</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">trying.Our teacher, professor Ulivi, was a nice guy. He could see I worked</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">hard, and gave me a good grade, which he wrote down in a sort of</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">passport each student had. But the Accademia wasn&#39;t teaching me</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">anything except Italian, and my money was running out, so at the</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">end of the first year I went back to the US.I wanted to go back to RISD, but I was now broke and RISD was very</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">expensive, so I decided to get a job for a year and then return to</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">RISD the next fall. I got one at a company called Interleaf, which</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">made software for creating documents. You mean like Microsoft Word?</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">Exactly. That was how I learned that low end software tends to eat</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">high end software. But Interleaf still had a few years to live yet.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">[5]Interleaf had done something pretty bold. Inspired by Emacs, they&#39;d</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">added a scripting language, and even made the scripting language a</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">dialect of Lisp. Now they wanted a Lisp hacker to write things in</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">it. This was the closest thing I&#39;ve had to a normal job, and I</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">hereby apologize to my boss and coworkers, because I was a bad</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">employee. Their Lisp was the thinnest icing on a giant C cake, and</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">since I didn&#39;t know C and didn&#39;t want to learn it, I never understood</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">most of the software. Plus I was terribly irresponsible. This was</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">back when a programming job meant showing up every day during certain</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">working hours. That seemed unnatural to me, and on this point the</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">rest of the world is coming around to my way of thinking, but at</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">the time it caused a lot of friction. Toward the end of the year I</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">spent much of my time surreptitiously working on On Lisp, which I</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">had by this time gotten a contract to publish.The good part was that I got paid huge amounts of money, especially</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">by art student standards. In Florence, after paying my part of the</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">rent, my budget for everything else had been $7 a day. Now I was</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">getting paid more than 4 times that every hour, even when I was</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">just sitting in a meeting. By living cheaply I not only managed to</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">save enough to go back to RISD, but also paid off my college loans.I learned some useful things at Interleaf, though they were mostly</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">about what not to do. I learned that it&#39;s better for technology</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">companies to be run by product people than sales people (though</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">sales is a real skill and people who are good at it are really good</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">at it), that it leads to bugs when code is edited by too many people,</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">that cheap office space is no bargain if it&#39;s depressing, that</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">planned meetings are inferior to corridor conversations, that big,</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">bureaucratic customers are a dangerous source of money, and that</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">there&#39;s not much overlap between conventional office hours and the</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">optimal time for hacking, or conventional offices and the optimal</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">place for it.But the most important thing I learned, and which I used in both</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">Viaweb and Y Combinator, is that the low end eats the high end:</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">that it&#39;s good to be the &quot;entry level&quot; option, even though that</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">will be less prestigious, because if you&#39;re not, someone else will</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">be, and will squash you against the ceiling. Which in turn means</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">that prestige is a danger sign.When I left to go back to RISD the next fall, I arranged to do</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">freelance work for the group that did projects for customers, and</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">this was how I survived for the next several years. When I came</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">back to visit for a project later on, someone told me about a new</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">thing called HTML, which was, as he described it, a derivative of</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">SGML. Markup language enthusiasts were an occupational hazard at</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">Interleaf and I ignored him, but this HTML thing later became a big</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">part of my life.In the fall of 1992 I moved back to Providence to continue at RISD.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">The foundation had merely been intro stuff, and the Accademia had</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">been a (very civilized) joke. Now I was going to see what real art</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">school was like. But alas it was more like the Accademia than not.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">Better organized, certainly, and a lot more expensive, but it was</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">now becoming clear that art school did not bear the same relationship</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">to art that medical school bore to medicine. At least not the</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">painting department. The textile department, which my next door</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">neighbor belonged to, seemed to be pretty rigorous. No doubt</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">illustration and architecture were too. But painting was post-rigorous.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">Painting students were supposed to express themselves, which to the</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">more worldly ones meant to try to cook up some sort of distinctive</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">signature style.A signature style is the visual equivalent of what in show business</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">is known as a &quot;schtick&quot;: something that immediately identifies the</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">work as yours and no one else&#39;s. For example, when you see a painting</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">that looks like a certain kind of cartoon, you know it&#39;s by Roy</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">Lichtenstein. So if you see a big painting of this type hanging in</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">the apartment of a hedge fund manager, you know he paid millions</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">of dollars for it. That&#39;s not always why artists have a signature</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">style, but it&#39;s usually why buyers pay a lot for such work.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">[6]There were plenty of earnest students too: kids who &quot;could draw&quot;</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">in high school, and now had come to what was supposed to be the</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">best art school in the country, to learn to draw even better. They</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">tended to be confused and demoralized by what they found at RISD,</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">but they kept going, because painting was what they did. I was not</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">one of the kids who could draw in high school, but at RISD I was</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">definitely closer to their tribe than the tribe of signature style</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">seekers.I learned a lot in the color class I took at RISD, but otherwise I</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">was basically teaching myself to paint, and I could do that for</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">free. So in 1993 I dropped out. I hung around Providence for a bit,</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">and then my college friend Nancy Parmet did me a big favor. A</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">rent-controlled apartment in a building her mother owned in New</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">York was becoming vacant. Did I want it? It wasn&#39;t much more than</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">my current place, and New York was supposed to be where the artists</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">were. So yes, I wanted it!</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">[7]Asterix comics begin by zooming in on a tiny corner of Roman Gaul</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">that turns out not to be controlled by the Romans. You can do</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">something similar on a map of New York City: if you zoom in on the</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">Upper East Side, there&#39;s a tiny corner that&#39;s not rich, or at least</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">wasn&#39;t in 1993. It&#39;s called Yorkville, and that was my new home.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">Now I was a New York artist  in the strictly technical sense of</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">making paintings and living in New York.I was nervous about money, because I could sense that Interleaf was</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">on the way down. Freelance Lisp hacking work was very rare, and I</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">didn&#39;t want to have to program in another language, which in those</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">days would have meant C++ if I was lucky. So with my unerring nose</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">for financial opportunity, I decided to write another book on Lisp.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">This would be a popular book, the sort of book that could be used</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">as a textbook. I imagined myself living frugally off the royalties</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">and spending all my time painting. (The painting on the cover of</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">this book, ANSI Common Lisp, is one that I painted around this</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">time.)The best thing about New York for me was the presence of Idelle and</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">Julian Weber. Idelle Weber was a painter, one of the early</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">photorealists, and I&#39;d taken her painting class at Harvard. I&#39;ve</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">never known a teacher more beloved by her students. Large numbers</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">of former students kept in touch with her, including me. After I</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">moved to New York I became her de facto studio assistant.She liked to paint on big, square canvases, 4 to 5 feet on a side.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">One day in late 1994 as I was stretching one of these monsters there</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">was something on the radio about a famous fund manager. He wasn&#39;t</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">that much older than me, and was super rich. The thought suddenly</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">occurred to me: why don&#39;t I become rich? Then I&#39;ll be able to work</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">on whatever I want.Meanwhile I&#39;d been hearing more and more about this new thing called</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">the World Wide Web. Robert Morris showed it to me when I visited</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">him in Cambridge, where he was now in grad school at Harvard. It</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">seemed to me that the web would be a big deal. I&#39;d seen what graphical</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">user interfaces had done for the popularity of microcomputers. It</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">seemed like the web would do the same for the internet.If I wanted to get rich, here was the next train leaving the station.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">I was right about that part. What I got wrong was the idea. I decided</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">we should start a company to put art galleries online. I can&#39;t</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">honestly say, after reading so many Y Combinator applications, that</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">this was the worst startup idea ever, but it was up there. Art</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">galleries didn&#39;t want to be online, and still don&#39;t, not the fancy</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">ones. That&#39;s not how they sell. I wrote some software to generate</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">web sites for galleries, and Robert wrote some to resize images and</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">set up an http server to serve the pages. Then we tried to sign up</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">galleries. To call this a difficult sale would be an understatement.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">It was difficult to give away. A few galleries let us make sites</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">for them for free, but none paid us.Then some online stores started to appear, and I realized that</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">except for the order buttons they were identical to the sites we&#39;d</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">been generating for galleries. This impressive-sounding thing called</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">an &quot;internet storefront&quot; was something we already knew how to build.So in the summer of 1995, after I submitted the camera-ready copy</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">of ANSI Common Lisp to the publishers, we started trying to write</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">software to build online stores. At first this was going to be</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">normal desktop software, which in those days meant Windows software.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">That was an alarming prospect, because neither of us knew how to</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">write Windows software or wanted to learn. We lived in the Unix</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">world. But we decided we&#39;d at least try writing a prototype store</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">builder on Unix. Robert wrote a shopping cart, and I wrote a new</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">site generator for stores  in Lisp, of course.We were working out of Robert&#39;s apartment in Cambridge. His roommate</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">was away for big chunks of time, during which I got to sleep in his</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">room. For some reason there was no bed frame or sheets, just a</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">mattress on the floor. One morning as I was lying on this mattress</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">I had an idea that made me sit up like a capital L. What if we ran</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">the software on the server, and let users control it by clicking</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">on links? Then we&#39;d never have to write anything to run on users&#39;</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">computers. We could generate the sites on the same server we&#39;d serve</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">them from. Users wouldn&#39;t need anything more than a browser.This kind of software, known as a web app, is common now, but at</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">the time it wasn&#39;t clear that it was even possible. To find out,</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">we decided to try making a version of our store builder that you</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">could control through the browser. A couple days later, on August</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">12, we had one that worked. The UI was horrible, but it proved you</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">could build a whole store through the browser, without any client</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">software or typing anything into the command line on the server.Now we felt like we were really onto something. I had visions of a</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">whole new generation of software working this way. You wouldn&#39;t</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">need versions, or ports, or any of that crap. At Interleaf there</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">had been a whole group called Release Engineering that seemed to</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">be at least as big as the group that actually wrote the software.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">Now you could just update the software right on the server.We started a new company we called Viaweb, after the fact that our</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">software worked via the web, and we got $10,000 in seed funding</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">from Idelle&#39;s husband Julian. In return for that and doing the</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">initial legal work and giving us business advice, we gave him 10%</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">of the company. Ten years later this deal became the model for Y</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">Combinator&#39;s. We knew founders needed something like this, because</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">we&#39;d needed it ourselves.At this stage I had a negative net worth, because the thousand</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">dollars or so I had in the bank was more than counterbalanced by</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">what I owed the government in taxes. (Had I diligently set aside</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">the proper proportion of the money I&#39;d made consulting for Interleaf?</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">No, I had not.) So although Robert had his graduate student stipend,</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">I needed that seed funding to live on.We originally hoped to launch in September, but we got more ambitious</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">about the software as we worked on it. Eventually we managed to</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">build a WYSIWYG site builder, in the sense that as you were creating</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">pages, they looked exactly like the static ones that would be</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">generated later, except that instead of leading to static pages,</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">the links all referred to closures stored in a hash table on the</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">server.It helped to have studied art, because the main goal of an online</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">store builder is to make users look legit, and the key to looking</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">legit is high production values. If you get page layouts and fonts</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">and colors right, you can make a guy running a store out of his</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">bedroom look more legit than a big company.(If you&#39;re curious why my site looks so old-fashioned, it&#39;s because</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">it&#39;s still made with this software. It may look clunky today, but</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">in 1996 it was the last word in slick.)In September, Robert rebelled. &quot;We&#39;ve been working on this for a</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">month,&quot; he said, &quot;and it&#39;s still not done.&quot; This is funny in</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">retrospect, because he would still be working on it almost 3 years</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">later. But I decided it might be prudent to recruit more programmers,</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">and I asked Robert who else in grad school with him was really good.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">He recommended Trevor Blackwell, which surprised me at first, because</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">at that point I knew Trevor mainly for his plan to reduce everything</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">in his life to a stack of notecards, which he carried around with</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">him. But Rtm was right, as usual. Trevor turned out to be a</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">frighteningly effective hacker.It was a lot of fun working with Robert and Trevor. They&#39;re the two</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">most independent-minded people</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">I know, and in completely different</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">ways. If you could see inside Rtm&#39;s brain it would look like a</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">colonial New England church, and if you could see inside Trevor&#39;s</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">it would look like the worst excesses of Austrian Rococo.We opened for business, with 6 stores, in January 1996. It was just</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">as well we waited a few months, because although we worried we were</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">late, we were actually almost fatally early. There was a lot of</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">talk in the press then about ecommerce, but not many people actually</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">wanted online stores.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">[8]There were three main parts to the software: the editor, which</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">people used to build sites and which I wrote, the shopping cart,</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">which Robert wrote, and the manager, which kept track of orders and</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">statistics, and which Trevor wrote. In its time, the editor was one</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">of the best general-purpose site builders. I kept the code tight</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">and didn&#39;t have to integrate with any other software except Robert&#39;s</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">and Trevor&#39;s, so it was quite fun to work on. If all I&#39;d had to do</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">was work on this software, the next 3 years would have been the</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">easiest of my life. Unfortunately I had to do a lot more, all of</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">it stuff I was worse at than programming, and the next 3 years were</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">instead the most stressful.There were a lot of startups making ecommerce software in the second</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">half of the 90s. We were determined to be the Microsoft Word, not</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">the Interleaf. Which meant being easy to use and inexpensive. It</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">was lucky for us that we were poor, because that caused us to make</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">Viaweb even more inexpensive than we realized. We charged $100 a</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">month for a small store and $300 a month for a big one. This low</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">price was a big attraction, and a constant thorn in the sides of</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">competitors, but it wasn&#39;t because of some clever insight that we</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">set the price low. We had no idea what businesses paid for things.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">$300 a month seemed like a lot of money to us.We did a lot of things right by accident like that. For example,</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">we did what&#39;s now called &quot;doing things that</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">don&#39;t scale,&quot; although</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">at the time we would have described it as &quot;being so lame that we&#39;re</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">driven to the most desperate measures to get users.&quot; The most common</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">of which was building stores for them. This seemed particularly</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">humiliating, since the whole raison d&#39;etre of our software was that</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">people could use it to make their own stores. But anything to get</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">users.We learned a lot more about retail than we wanted to know. For</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">example, that if you could only have a small image of a man&#39;s shirt</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">(and all images were small then by present standards), it was better</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">to have a closeup of the collar than a picture of the whole shirt.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">The reason I remember learning this was that it meant I had to</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">rescan about 30 images of men&#39;s shirts. My first set of scans were</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">so beautiful too.Though this felt wrong, it was exactly the right thing to be doing.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">Building stores for users taught us about retail, and about how it</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">felt to use our software. I was initially both mystified and repelled</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">by &quot;business&quot; and thought we needed a &quot;business person&quot; to be in</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">charge of it, but once we started to get users, I was converted,</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">in much the same way I was converted to</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">fatherhood once I had kids.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">Whatever users wanted, I was all theirs. Maybe one day we&#39;d have</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">so many users that I couldn&#39;t scan their images for them, but in</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">the meantime there was nothing more important to do.Another thing I didn&#39;t get at the time is that</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">growth rate is the</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">ultimate test of a startup. Our growth rate was fine. We had about</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">70 stores at the end of 1996 and about 500 at the end of 1997. I</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">mistakenly thought the thing that mattered was the absolute number</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">of users. And that is the thing that matters in the sense that</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">that&#39;s how much money you&#39;re making, and if you&#39;re not making enough,</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">you might go out of business. But in the long term the growth rate</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">takes care of the absolute number. If we&#39;d been a startup I was</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">advising at Y Combinator, I would have said: Stop being so stressed</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">out, because you&#39;re doing fine. You&#39;re growing 7x a year. Just don&#39;t</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">hire too many more people and you&#39;ll soon be profitable, and then</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">you&#39;ll control your own destiny.Alas I hired lots more people, partly because our investors wanted</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">me to, and partly because that&#39;s what startups did during the</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">Internet Bubble. A company with just a handful of employees would</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">have seemed amateurish. So we didn&#39;t reach breakeven until about</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">when Yahoo bought us in the summer of 1998. Which in turn meant we</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">were at the mercy of investors for the entire life of the company.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">And since both we and our investors were noobs at startups, the</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">result was a mess even by startup standards.It was a huge relief when Yahoo bought us. In principle our Viaweb</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">stock was valuable. It was a share in a business that was profitable</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">and growing rapidly. But it didn&#39;t feel very valuable to me; I had</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">no idea how to value a business, but I was all too keenly aware of</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">the near-death experiences we seemed to have every few months. Nor</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">had I changed my grad student lifestyle significantly since we</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">started. So when Yahoo bought us it felt like going from rags to</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">riches. Since we were going to California, I bought a car, a yellow</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">1998 VW GTI. I remember thinking that its leather seats alone were</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">by far the most luxurious thing I owned.The next year, from the summer of 1998 to the summer of 1999, must</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">have been the least productive of my life. I didn&#39;t realize it at</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">the time, but I was worn out from the effort and stress of running</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">Viaweb. For a while after I got to California I tried to continue</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">my usual m.o. of programming till 3 in the morning, but fatigue</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">combined with Yahoo&#39;s prematurely aged</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">culture and grim cube farm</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">in Santa Clara gradually dragged me down. After a few months it</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">felt disconcertingly like working at Interleaf.Yahoo had given us a lot of options when they bought us. At the</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">time I thought Yahoo was so overvalued that they&#39;d never be worth</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">anything, but to my astonishment the stock went up 5x in the next</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">year. I hung on till the first chunk of options vested, then in the</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">summer of 1999 I left. It had been so long since I&#39;d painted anything</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">that I&#39;d half forgotten why I was doing this. My brain had been</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">entirely full of software and men&#39;s shirts for 4 years. But I had</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">done this to get rich so I could paint, I reminded myself, and now</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">I was rich, so I should go paint.When I said I was leaving, my boss at Yahoo had a long conversation</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">with me about my plans. I told him all about the kinds of pictures</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">I wanted to paint. At the time I was touched that he took such an</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">interest in me. Now I realize it was because he thought I was lying.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">My options at that point were worth about $2 million a month. If I</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">was leaving that kind of money on the table, it could only be to</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">go and start some new startup, and if I did, I might take people</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">with me. This was the height of the Internet Bubble, and Yahoo was</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">ground zero of it. My boss was at that moment a billionaire. Leaving</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">then to start a new startup must have seemed to him an insanely,</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">and yet also plausibly, ambitious plan.But I really was quitting to paint, and I started immediately.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">There was no time to lose. I&#39;d already burned 4 years getting rich.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">Now when I talk to founders who are leaving after selling their</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">companies, my advice is always the same: take a vacation. That&#39;s</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">what I should have done, just gone off somewhere and done nothing</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">for a month or two, but the idea never occurred to me.So I tried to paint, but I just didn&#39;t seem to have any energy or</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">ambition. Part of the problem was that I didn&#39;t know many people</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">in California. I&#39;d compounded this problem by buying a house up in</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">the Santa Cruz Mountains, with a beautiful view but miles from</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">anywhere. I stuck it out for a few more months, then in desperation</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">I went back to New York, where unless you understand about rent</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">control you&#39;ll be surprised to hear I still had my apartment, sealed</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">up like a tomb of my old life. Idelle was in New York at least, and</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">there were other people trying to paint there, even though I didn&#39;t</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">know any of them.When I got back to New York I resumed my old life, except now I was</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">rich. It was as weird as it sounds. I resumed all my old patterns,</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">except now there were doors where there hadn&#39;t been. Now when I was</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">tired of walking, all I had to do was raise my hand, and (unless</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">it was raining) a taxi would stop to pick me up. Now when I walked</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">past charming little restaurants I could go in and order lunch. It</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">was exciting for a while. Painting started to go better. I experimented</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">with a new kind of still life where I&#39;d paint one painting in the</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">old way, then photograph it and print it, blown up, on canvas, and</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">then use that as the underpainting for a second still life, painted</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">from the same objects (which hopefully hadn&#39;t rotted yet).Meanwhile I looked for an apartment to buy. Now I could actually</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">choose what neighborhood to live in. Where, I asked myself and</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">various real estate agents, is the Cambridge of New York? Aided by</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">occasional visits to actual Cambridge, I gradually realized there</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">wasn&#39;t one. Huh.Around this time, in the spring of 2000, I had an idea. It was clear</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">from our experience with Viaweb that web apps were the future. Why</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">not build a web app for making web apps? Why not let people edit</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">code on our server through the browser, and then host the resulting</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">applications for them?</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">[9]</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">You could run all sorts of services</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">on the servers that these applications could use just by making an</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">API call: making and receiving phone calls, manipulating images,</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">taking credit card payments, etc.I got so excited about this idea that I couldn&#39;t think about anything</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">else. It seemed obvious that this was the future. I didn&#39;t particularly</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">want to start another company, but it was clear that this idea would</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">have to be embodied as one, so I decided to move to Cambridge and</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">start it. I hoped to lure Robert into working on it with me, but</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">there I ran into a hitch. Robert was now a postdoc at MIT, and</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">though he&#39;d made a lot of money the last time I&#39;d lured him into</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">working on one of my schemes, it had also been a huge time sink.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">So while he agreed that it sounded like a plausible idea, he firmly</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">refused to work on it.Hmph. Well, I&#39;d do it myself then. I recruited Dan Giffin, who had</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">worked for Viaweb, and two undergrads who wanted summer jobs, and</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">we got to work trying to build what it&#39;s now clear is about twenty</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">companies and several open source projects worth of software. The</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">language for defining applications would of course be a dialect of</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">Lisp. But I wasn&#39;t so naive as to assume I could spring an overt</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">Lisp on a general audience; we&#39;d hide the parentheses, like Dylan</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">did.By then there was a name for the kind of company Viaweb was, an</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">&quot;application service provider,&quot; or ASP. This name didn&#39;t last long</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">before it was replaced by &quot;software as a service,&quot; but it was current</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">for long enough that I named this new company after it: it was going</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">to be called Aspra.I started working on the application builder, Dan worked on network</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">infrastructure, and the two undergrads worked on the first two</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">services (images and phone calls). But about halfway through the</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">summer I realized I really didn&#39;t want to run a company  especially</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">not a big one, which it was looking like this would have to be. I&#39;d</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">only started Viaweb because I needed the money. Now that I didn&#39;t</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">need money anymore, why was I doing this? If this vision had to be</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">realized as a company, then screw the vision. I&#39;d build a subset</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">that could be done as an open source project.Much to my surprise, the time I spent working on this stuff was not</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">wasted after all. After we started Y Combinator, I would often</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">encounter startups working on parts of this new architecture, and</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">it was very useful to have spent so much time thinking about it and</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">even trying to write some of it.The subset I would build as an open source project was the new Lisp,</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">whose parentheses I now wouldn&#39;t even have to hide. A lot of Lisp</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">hackers dream of building a new Lisp, partly because one of the</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">distinctive features of the language is that it has dialects, and</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">partly, I think, because we have in our minds a Platonic form of</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">Lisp that all existing dialects fall short of. I certainly did. So</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">at the end of the summer Dan and I switched to working on this new</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">dialect of Lisp, which I called Arc, in a house I bought in Cambridge.The following spring, lightning struck. I was invited to give a</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">talk at a Lisp conference, so I gave one about how we&#39;d used Lisp</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">at Viaweb. Afterward I put a postscript file of this talk online,</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">on paulgraham.com, which I&#39;d created years before using Viaweb but</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">had never used for anything. In one day it got 30,000 page views.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">What on earth had happened? The referring urls showed that someone</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">had posted it on Slashdot.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">[10]Wow, I thought, there&#39;s an audience. If I write something and put</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">it on the web, anyone can read it. That may seem obvious now, but</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">it was surprising then. In the print era there was a narrow channel</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">to readers, guarded by fierce monsters known as editors. The only</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">way to get an audience for anything you wrote was to get it published</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">as a book, or in a newspaper or magazine. Now anyone could publish</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">anything.This had been possible in principle since 1993, but not many people</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">had realized it yet. I had been intimately involved with building</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">the infrastructure of the web for most of that time, and a writer</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">as well, and it had taken me 8 years to realize it. Even then it</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">took me several years to understand the implications. It meant there</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">would be a whole new generation of</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">essays.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">[11]In the print era, the channel for publishing essays had been</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">vanishingly small. Except for a few officially anointed thinkers</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">who went to the right parties in New York, the only people allowed</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">to publish essays were specialists writing about their specialties.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">There were so many essays that had never been written, because there</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">had been no way to publish them. Now they could be, and I was going</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">to write them.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">[12]I&#39;ve worked on several different things, but to the extent there</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">was a turning point where I figured out what to work on, it was</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">when I started publishing essays online. From then on I knew that</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">whatever else I did, I&#39;d always write essays too.I knew that online essays would be a</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">marginal medium at first.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">Socially they&#39;d seem more like rants posted by nutjobs on their</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">GeoCities sites than the genteel and beautifully typeset compositions</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">published in The New Yorker. But by this point I knew enough to</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">find that encouraging instead of discouraging.One of the most conspicuous patterns I&#39;ve noticed in my life is how</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">well it has worked, for me at least, to work on things that weren&#39;t</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">prestigious. Still life has always been the least prestigious form</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">of painting. Viaweb and Y Combinator both seemed lame when we started</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">them. I still get the glassy eye from strangers when they ask what</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">I&#39;m writing, and I explain that it&#39;s an essay I&#39;m going to publish</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">on my web site. Even Lisp, though prestigious intellectually in</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">something like the way Latin is, also seems about as hip.It&#39;s not that unprestigious types of work are good per se. But when</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">you find yourself drawn to some kind of work despite its current</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">lack of prestige, it&#39;s a sign both that there&#39;s something real to</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">be discovered there, and that you have the right kind of motives.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">Impure motives are a big danger for the ambitious. If anything is</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">going to lead you astray, it will be the desire to impress people.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">So while working on things that aren&#39;t prestigious doesn&#39;t guarantee</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">you&#39;re on the right track, it at least guarantees you&#39;re not on the</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">most common type of wrong one.Over the next several years I wrote lots of essays about all kinds</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">of different topics. O&#39;Reilly reprinted a collection of them as a</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">book, called Hackers &amp; Painters after one of the essays in it. I</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">also worked on spam filters, and did some more painting. I used to</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">have dinners for a group of friends every thursday night, which</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">taught me how to cook for groups. And I bought another building in</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">Cambridge, a former candy factory (and later, twas said, porn</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">studio), to use as an office.One night in October 2003 there was a big party at my house. It was</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">a clever idea of my friend Maria Daniels, who was one of the thursday</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">diners. Three separate hosts would all invite their friends to one</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">party. So for every guest, two thirds of the other guests would be</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">people they didn&#39;t know but would probably like. One of the guests</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">was someone I didn&#39;t know but would turn out to like a lot: a woman</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">called Jessica Livingston. A couple days later I asked her out.Jessica was in charge of marketing at a Boston investment bank.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">This bank thought it understood startups, but over the next year,</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">as she met friends of mine from the startup world, she was surprised</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">how different reality was. And how colorful their stories were. So</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">she decided to compile a book of</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">interviews with startup founders.When the bank had financial problems and she had to fire half her</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">staff, she started looking for a new job. In early 2005 she interviewed</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">for a marketing job at a Boston VC firm. It took them weeks to make</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">up their minds, and during this time I started telling her about</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">all the things that needed to be fixed about venture capital. They</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">should make a larger number of smaller investments instead of a</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">handful of giant ones, they should be funding younger, more technical</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">founders instead of MBAs, they should let the founders remain as</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">CEO, and so on.One of my tricks for writing essays had always been to give talks.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">The prospect of having to stand up in front of a group of people</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">and tell them something that won&#39;t waste their time is a great</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">spur to the imagination. When the Harvard Computer Society, the</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">undergrad computer club, asked me to give a talk, I decided I would</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">tell them how to start a startup. Maybe they&#39;d be able to avoid the</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">worst of the mistakes we&#39;d made.So I gave this talk, in the course of which I told them that the</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">best sources of seed funding were successful startup founders,</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">because then they&#39;d be sources of advice too. Whereupon it seemed</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">they were all looking expectantly at me. Horrified at the prospect</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">of having my inbox flooded by business plans (if I&#39;d only known),</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">I blurted out &quot;But not me!&quot; and went on with the talk. But afterward</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">it occurred to me that I should really stop procrastinating about</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">angel investing. I&#39;d been meaning to since Yahoo bought us, and now</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">it was 7 years later and I still hadn&#39;t done one angel investment.Meanwhile I had been scheming with Robert and Trevor about projects</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">we could work on together. I missed working with them, and it seemed</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">like there had to be something we could collaborate on.As Jessica and I were walking home from dinner on March 11, at the</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">corner of Garden and Walker streets, these three threads converged.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">Screw the VCs who were taking so long to make up their minds. We&#39;d</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">start our own investment firm and actually implement the ideas we&#39;d</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">been talking about. I&#39;d fund it, and Jessica could quit her job and</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">work for it, and we&#39;d get Robert and Trevor as partners too.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">[13]Once again, ignorance worked in our favor. We had no idea how to</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">be angel investors, and in Boston in 2005 there were no Ron Conways</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">to learn from. So we just made what seemed like the obvious choices,</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">and some of the things we did turned out to be novel.There are multiple components to Y Combinator, and we didn&#39;t figure</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">them all out at once. The part we got first was to be an angel firm.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">In those days, those two words didn&#39;t go together. There were VC</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">firms, which were organized companies with people whose job it was</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">to make investments, but they only did big, million dollar investments.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">And there were angels, who did smaller investments, but these were</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">individuals who were usually focused on other things and made</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">investments on the side. And neither of them helped founders enough</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">in the beginning. We knew how helpless founders were in some respects,</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">because we remembered how helpless we&#39;d been. For example, one thing</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">Julian had done for us that seemed to us like magic was to get us</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">set up as a company. We were fine writing fairly difficult software,</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">but actually getting incorporated, with bylaws and stock and all</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">that stuff, how on earth did you do that? Our plan was not only to</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">make seed investments, but to do for startups everything Julian had</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">done for us.YC was not organized as a fund. It was cheap enough to run that we</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">funded it with our own money. That went right by 99% of readers,</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">but professional investors are thinking &quot;Wow, that means they got</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">all the returns.&quot; But once again, this was not due to any particular</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">insight on our part. We didn&#39;t know how VC firms were organized.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">It never occurred to us to try to raise a fund, and if it had, we</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">wouldn&#39;t have known where to start.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">[14]The most distinctive thing about YC is the batch model: to fund a</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">bunch of startups all at once, twice a year, and then to spend three</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">months focusing intensively on trying to help them. That part we</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">discovered by accident, not merely implicitly but explicitly due</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">to our ignorance about investing. We needed to get experience as</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">investors. What better way, we thought, than to fund a whole bunch</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">of startups at once? We knew undergrads got temporary jobs at tech</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">companies during the summer. Why not organize a summer program where</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">they&#39;d start startups instead? We wouldn&#39;t feel guilty for being</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">in a sense fake investors, because they would in a similar sense</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">be fake founders. So while we probably wouldn&#39;t make much money out</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">of it, we&#39;d at least get to practice being investors on them, and</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">they for their part would probably have a more interesting summer</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">than they would working at Microsoft.We&#39;d use the building I owned in Cambridge as our headquarters.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">We&#39;d all have dinner there once a week  on tuesdays, since I was</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">already cooking for the thursday diners on thursdays  and after</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">dinner we&#39;d bring in experts on startups to give talks.We knew undergrads were deciding then about summer jobs, so in a</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">matter of days we cooked up something we called the Summer Founders</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">Program, and I posted an</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">announcement</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">on my site, inviting undergrads</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">to apply. I had never imagined that writing essays would be a way</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">to get &quot;deal flow,&quot; as investors call it, but it turned out to be</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">the perfect source.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">[15]</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">We got 225 applications for the Summer</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">Founders Program, and we were surprised to find that a lot of them</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">were from people who&#39;d already graduated, or were about to that</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">spring. Already this SFP thing was starting to feel more serious</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">than we&#39;d intended.We invited about 20 of the 225 groups to interview in person, and</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">from those we picked 8 to fund. They were an impressive group. That</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">first batch included reddit, Justin Kan and Emmett Shear, who went</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">on to found Twitch, Aaron Swartz, who had already helped write the</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">RSS spec and would a few years later become a martyr for open access,</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">and Sam Altman, who would later become the second president of YC.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">I don&#39;t think it was entirely luck that the first batch was so good.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">You had to be pretty bold to sign up for a weird thing like the</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">Summer Founders Program instead of a summer job at a legit place</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">like Microsoft or Goldman Sachs.The deal for startups was based on a combination of the deal we did</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">with Julian ($10k for 10%) and what Robert said MIT grad students</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">got for the summer ($6k). We invested $6k per founder, which in the</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">typical two-founder case was $12k, in return for 6%. That had to</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">be fair, because it was twice as good as the deal we ourselves had</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">taken. Plus that first summer, which was really hot, Jessica brought</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">the founders free air conditioners.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">[16]Fairly quickly I realized that we had stumbled upon the way to scale</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">startup funding. Funding startups in batches was more convenient</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">for us, because it meant we could do things for a lot of startups</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">at once, but being part of a batch was better for the startups too.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">It solved one of the biggest problems faced by founders: the</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">isolation. Now you not only had colleagues, but colleagues who</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">understood the problems you were facing and could tell you how they</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">were solving them.As YC grew, we started to notice other advantages of scale. The</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">alumni became a tight community, dedicated to helping one another,</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">and especially the current batch, whose shoes they remembered being</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">in. We also noticed that the startups were becoming one another&#39;s</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">customers. We used to refer jokingly to the &quot;YC GDP,&quot; but as YC</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">grows this becomes less and less of a joke. Now lots of startups</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">get their initial set of customers almost entirely from among their</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">batchmates.I had not originally intended YC to be a full-time job. I was going</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">to do three things: hack, write essays, and work on YC. As YC grew,</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">and I grew more excited about it, it started to take up a lot more</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">than a third of my attention. But for the first few years I was</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">still able to work on other things.In the summer of 2006, Robert and I started working on a new version</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">of Arc. This one was reasonably fast, because it was compiled into</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">Scheme. To test this new Arc, I wrote Hacker News in it. It was</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">originally meant to be a news aggregator for startup founders and</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">was called Startup News, but after a few months I got tired of</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">reading about nothing but startups. Plus it wasn&#39;t startup founders</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">we wanted to reach. It was future startup founders. So I changed</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">the name to Hacker News and the topic to whatever engaged one&#39;s</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">intellectual curiosity.HN was no doubt good for YC, but it was also by far the biggest</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">source of stress for me. If all I&#39;d had to do was select and help</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">founders, life would have been so easy. And that implies that HN</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">was a mistake. Surely the biggest source of stress in one&#39;s work</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">should at least be something close to the core of the work. Whereas</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">I was like someone who was in pain while running a marathon not</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">from the exertion of running, but because I had a blister from an</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">ill-fitting shoe. When I was dealing with some urgent problem during</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">YC, there was about a 60% chance it had to do with HN, and a 40%</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">chance it had do with everything else combined.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">[17]As well as HN, I wrote all of YC&#39;s internal software in Arc. But</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">while I continued to work a good deal in Arc, I gradually stopped</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">working on Arc, partly because I didn&#39;t have time to, and partly</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">because it was a lot less attractive to mess around with the language</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">now that we had all this infrastructure depending on it. So now my</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">three projects were reduced to two: writing essays and working on</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">YC.YC was different from other kinds of work I&#39;ve done. Instead of</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">deciding for myself what to work on, the problems came to me. Every</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">6 months there was a new batch of startups, and their problems,</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">whatever they were, became our problems. It was very engaging work,</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">because their problems were quite varied, and the good founders</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">were very effective. If you were trying to learn the most you could</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">about startups in the shortest possible time, you couldn&#39;t have</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">picked a better way to do it.There were parts of the job I didn&#39;t like. Disputes between cofounders,</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">figuring out when people were lying to us, fighting with people who</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">maltreated the startups, and so on. But I worked hard even at the</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">parts I didn&#39;t like. I was haunted by something Kevin Hale once</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">said about companies: &quot;No one works harder than the boss.&quot; He meant</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">it both descriptively and prescriptively, and it was the second</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">part that scared me. I wanted YC to be good, so if how hard I worked</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">set the upper bound on how hard everyone else worked, I&#39;d better</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">work very hard.One day in 2010, when he was visiting California for interviews,</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">Robert Morris did something astonishing: he offered me unsolicited</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">advice. I can only remember him doing that once before. One day at</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">Viaweb, when I was bent over double from a kidney stone, he suggested</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">that it would be a good idea for him to take me to the hospital.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">That was what it took for Rtm to offer unsolicited advice. So I</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">remember his exact words very clearly. &quot;You know,&quot; he said, &quot;you</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">should make sure Y Combinator isn&#39;t the last cool thing you do.&quot;At the time I didn&#39;t understand what he meant, but gradually it</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">dawned on me that he was saying I should quit. This seemed strange</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">advice, because YC was doing great. But if there was one thing rarer</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">than Rtm offering advice, it was Rtm being wrong. So this set me</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">thinking. It was true that on my current trajectory, YC would be</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">the last thing I did, because it was only taking up more of my</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">attention. It had already eaten Arc, and was in the process of</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">eating essays too. Either YC was my life&#39;s work or I&#39;d have to leave</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">eventually. And it wasn&#39;t, so I would.In the summer of 2012 my mother had a stroke, and the cause turned</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">out to be a blood clot caused by colon cancer. The stroke destroyed</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">her balance, and she was put in a nursing home, but she really</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">wanted to get out of it and back to her house, and my sister and I</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">were determined to help her do it. I used to fly up to Oregon to</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">visit her regularly, and I had a lot of time to think on those</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">flights. On one of them I realized I was ready to hand YC over to</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">someone else.I asked Jessica if she wanted to be president, but she didn&#39;t, so</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">we decided we&#39;d try to recruit Sam Altman. We talked to Robert and</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">Trevor and we agreed to make it a complete changing of the guard.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">Up till that point YC had been controlled by the original LLC we</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">four had started. But we wanted YC to last for a long time, and to</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">do that it couldn&#39;t be controlled by the founders. So if Sam said</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">yes, we&#39;d let him reorganize YC. Robert and I would retire, and</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">Jessica and Trevor would become ordinary partners.When we asked Sam if he wanted to be president of YC, initially he</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">said no. He wanted to start a startup to make nuclear reactors.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">But I kept at it, and in October 2013 he finally agreed. We decided</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">he&#39;d take over starting with the winter 2014 batch. For the rest</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">of 2013 I left running YC more and more to Sam, partly so he could</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">learn the job, and partly because I was focused on my mother, whose</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">cancer had returned.She died on January 15, 2014. We knew this was coming, but it was</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">still hard when it did.I kept working on YC till March, to help get that batch of startups</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">through Demo Day, then I checked out pretty completely. (I still</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">talk to alumni and to new startups working on things I&#39;m interested</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">in, but that only takes a few hours a week.)What should I do next? Rtm&#39;s advice hadn&#39;t included anything about</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">that. I wanted to do something completely different, so I decided</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">I&#39;d paint. I wanted to see how good I could get if I really focused</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">on it. So the day after I stopped working on YC, I started painting.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">I was rusty and it took a while to get back into shape, but it was</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">at least completely engaging.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">[18]I spent most of the rest of 2014 painting. I&#39;d never been able to</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">work so uninterruptedly before, and I got to be better than I had</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">been. Not good enough, but better. Then in November, right in the</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">middle of a painting, I ran out of steam. Up till that point I&#39;d</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">always been curious to see how the painting I was working on would</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">turn out, but suddenly finishing this one seemed like a chore. So</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">I stopped working on it and cleaned my brushes and haven&#39;t painted</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">since. So far anyway.I realize that sounds rather wimpy. But attention is a zero sum</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">game. If you can choose what to work on, and you choose a project</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">that&#39;s not the best one (or at least a good one) for you, then it&#39;s</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">getting in the way of another project that is. And at 50 there was</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">some opportunity cost to screwing around.I started writing essays again, and wrote a bunch of new ones over</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">the next few months. I even wrote a couple that</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">weren&#39;t about</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">startups. Then in March 2015 I started working on Lisp again.The distinctive thing about Lisp is that its core is a language</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">defined by writing an interpreter in itself. It wasn&#39;t originally</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">intended as a programming language in the ordinary sense. It was</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">meant to be a formal model of computation, an alternative to the</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">Turing machine. If you want to write an interpreter for a language</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">in itself, what&#39;s the minimum set of predefined operators you need?</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">The Lisp that John McCarthy invented, or more accurately discovered,</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">is an answer to that question.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">[19]McCarthy didn&#39;t realize this Lisp could even be used to program</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">computers till his grad student Steve Russell suggested it. Russell</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">translated McCarthy&#39;s interpreter into IBM 704 machine language,</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">and from that point Lisp started also to be a programming language</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">in the ordinary sense. But its origins as a model of computation</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">gave it a power and elegance that other languages couldn&#39;t match.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">It was this that attracted me in college, though I didn&#39;t understand</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">why at the time.McCarthy&#39;s 1960 Lisp did nothing more than interpret Lisp expressions.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">It was missing a lot of things you&#39;d want in a programming language.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">So these had to be added, and when they were, they weren&#39;t defined</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">using McCarthy&#39;s original axiomatic approach. That wouldn&#39;t have</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">been feasible at the time. McCarthy tested his interpreter by</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">hand-simulating the execution of programs. But it was already getting</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">close to the limit of interpreters you could test that way  indeed,</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">there was a bug in it that McCarthy had overlooked. To test a more</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">complicated interpreter, you&#39;d have had to run it, and computers</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">then weren&#39;t powerful enough.Now they are, though. Now you could continue using McCarthy&#39;s</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">axiomatic approach till you&#39;d defined a complete programming language.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">And as long as every change you made to McCarthy&#39;s Lisp was a</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">discoveredness-preserving transformation, you could, in principle,</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">end up with a complete language that had this quality. Harder to</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">do than to talk about, of course, but if it was possible in principle,</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">why not try? So I decided to take a shot at it. It took 4 years,</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">from March 26, 2015 to October 12, 2019. It was fortunate that I</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">had a precisely defined goal, or it would have been hard to keep</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">at it for so long.I wrote this new Lisp, called Bel,</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">in itself in Arc. That may sound</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">like a contradiction, but it&#39;s an indication of the sort of trickery</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">I had to engage in to make this work. By means of an egregious</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">collection of hacks I managed to make something close enough to an</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">interpreter written in itself that could actually run. Not fast,</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">but fast enough to test.I had to ban myself from writing essays during most of this time,</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">or I&#39;d never have finished. In late 2015 I spent 3 months writing</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">essays, and when I went back to working on Bel I could barely</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">understand the code. Not so much because it was badly written as</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">because the problem is so convoluted. When you&#39;re working on an</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">interpreter written in itself, it&#39;s hard to keep track of what&#39;s</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">happening at what level, and errors can be practically encrypted</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">by the time you get them.So I said no more essays till Bel was done. But I told few people</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">about Bel while I was working on it. So for years it must have</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">seemed that I was doing nothing, when in fact I was working harder</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">than I&#39;d ever worked on anything. Occasionally after wrestling for</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">hours with some gruesome bug I&#39;d check Twitter or HN and see someone</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">asking &quot;Does Paul Graham still code?&quot;Working on Bel was hard but satisfying. I worked on it so intensively</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">that at any given time I had a decent chunk of the code in my head</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">and could write more there. I remember taking the boys to the</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">coast on a sunny day in 2015 and figuring out how to deal with some</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">problem involving continuations while I watched them play in the</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">tide pools. It felt like I was doing life right. I remember that</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">because I was slightly dismayed at how novel it felt. The good news</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">is that I had more moments like this over the next few years.In the summer of 2016 we moved to England. We wanted our kids to</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">see what it was like living in another country, and since I was a</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">British citizen by birth, that seemed the obvious choice. We only</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">meant to stay for a year, but we liked it so much that we still</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">live there. So most of Bel was written in England.In the fall of 2019, Bel was finally finished. Like McCarthy&#39;s</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">original Lisp, it&#39;s a spec rather than an implementation, although</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">like McCarthy&#39;s Lisp it&#39;s a spec expressed as code.Now that I could write essays again, I wrote a bunch about topics</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">I&#39;d had stacked up. I kept writing essays through 2020, but I also</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">started to think about other things I could work on. How should I</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">choose what to do? Well, how had I chosen what to work on in the</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">past? I wrote an essay for myself to answer that question, and I</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">was surprised how long and messy the answer turned out to be. If</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">this surprised me, who&#39;d lived it, then I thought perhaps it would</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">be interesting to other people, and encouraging to those with</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">similarly messy lives. So I wrote a more detailed version for others</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">to read, and this is the last sentence of it.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">Notes[1]</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">My experience skipped a step in the evolution of computers:</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">time-sharing machines with interactive OSes. I went straight from</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">batch processing to microcomputers, which made microcomputers seem</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">all the more exciting.[2]</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">Italian words for abstract concepts can nearly always be</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">predicted from their English cognates (except for occasional traps</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">like polluzione). It&#39;s the everyday words that differ. So if you</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">string together a lot of abstract concepts with a few simple verbs,</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">you can make a little Italian go a long way.[3]</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">I lived at Piazza San Felice 4, so my walk to the Accademia</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">went straight down the spine of old Florence: past the Pitti, across</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">the bridge, past Orsanmichele, between the Duomo and the Baptistery,</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">and then up Via Ricasoli to Piazza San Marco. I saw Florence at</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">street level in every possible condition, from empty dark winter</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">evenings to sweltering summer days when the streets were packed with</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">tourists.[4]</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">You can of course paint people like still lives if you want</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">to, and they&#39;re willing. That sort of portrait is arguably the apex</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">of still life painting, though the long sitting does tend to produce</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">pained expressions in the sitters.[5]</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">Interleaf was one of many companies that had smart people and</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">built impressive technology, and yet got crushed by Moore&#39;s Law.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">In the 1990s the exponential growth in the power of commodity (i.e.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">Intel) processors rolled up high-end, special-purpose hardware and</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">software companies like a bulldozer.[6]</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">The signature style seekers at RISD weren&#39;t specifically</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">mercenary. In the art world, money and coolness are tightly coupled.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">Anything expensive comes to be seen as cool, and anything seen as</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">cool will soon become equally expensive.[7]</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">Technically the apartment wasn&#39;t rent-controlled but</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">rent-stabilized, but this is a refinement only New Yorkers would</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">know or care about. The point is that it was really cheap, less</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">than half market price.[8]</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">Most software you can launch as soon as it&#39;s done. But when</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">the software is an online store builder and you&#39;re hosting the</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">stores, if you don&#39;t have any users yet, that fact will be painfully</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">obvious. So before we could launch publicly we had to launch</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">privately, in the sense of recruiting an initial set of users and</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">making sure they had decent-looking stores.[9]</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">We&#39;d had a code editor in Viaweb for users to define their</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">own page styles. They didn&#39;t know it, but they were editing Lisp</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">expressions underneath. But this wasn&#39;t an app editor, because the</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">code ran when the merchants&#39; sites were generated, not when shoppers</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">visited them.[10]</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">This was the first instance of what is now a familiar experience,</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">and so was what happened next, when I read the comments and found</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">they were full of angry people. How could I claim that Lisp was</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">better than other languages? Weren&#39;t they all Turing complete?</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">People who see the responses to essays I write sometimes tell me</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">how sorry they feel for me, but I&#39;m not exaggerating when I reply</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">that it has always been like this, since the very beginning. It</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">comes with the territory. An essay must tell readers things they</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">don&#39;t already know, and some</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">people dislike being told such things.[11]</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">People put plenty of stuff on the internet in the 90s of</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">course, but putting something online is not the same as publishing</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">it online. Publishing online means you treat the online version as</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">the (or at least a) primary version.[12]</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">There is a general lesson here that our experience with Y</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">Combinator also teaches: Customs continue to constrain you long</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">after the restrictions that caused them have disappeared. Customary</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">VC practice had once, like the customs about publishing essays,</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">been based on real constraints. Startups had once been much more</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">expensive to start, and proportionally rare. Now they could be cheap</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">and common, but the VCs&#39; customs still reflected the old world,</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">just as customs about writing essays still reflected the constraints</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">of the print era.Which in turn implies that people who are independent-minded (i.e.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">less influenced by custom) will have an advantage in fields affected</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">by rapid change (where customs are more likely to be obsolete).Here&#39;s an interesting point, though: you can&#39;t always predict which</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">fields will be affected by rapid change. Obviously software and</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">venture capital will be, but who would have predicted that essay</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">writing would be?[13]</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">Y Combinator was not the original name. At first we were</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">called Cambridge Seed. But we didn&#39;t want a regional name, in case</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">someone copied us in Silicon Valley, so we renamed ourselves after</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">one of the coolest tricks in the lambda calculus, the Y combinator.I picked orange as our color partly because it&#39;s the warmest, and</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">partly because no VC used it. In 2005 all the VCs used staid colors</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">like maroon, navy blue, and forest green, because they were trying</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">to appeal to LPs, not founders. The YC logo itself is an inside</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">joke: the Viaweb logo had been a white V on a red circle, so I made</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">the YC logo a white Y on an orange square.[14]</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">YC did become a fund for a couple years starting in 2009,</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">because it was getting so big I could no longer afford to fund it</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">personally. But after Heroku got bought we had enough money to go</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">back to being self-funded.[15]</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">I&#39;ve never liked the term &quot;deal flow,&quot; because it implies</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">that the number of new startups at any given time is fixed. This</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">is not only false, but it&#39;s the purpose of YC to falsify it, by</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">causing startups to be founded that would not otherwise have existed.[16]</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">She reports that they were all different shapes and sizes,</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">because there was a run on air conditioners and she had to get</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">whatever she could, but that they were all heavier than she could</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">carry now.[17]</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">Another problem with HN was a bizarre edge case that occurs</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">when you both write essays and run a forum. When you run a forum,</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">you&#39;re assumed to see if not every conversation, at least every</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">conversation involving you. And when you write essays, people post</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">highly imaginative misinterpretations of them on forums. Individually</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">these two phenomena are tedious but bearable, but the combination</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">is disastrous. You actually have to respond to the misinterpretations,</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">because the assumption that you&#39;re present in the conversation means</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">that not responding to any sufficiently upvoted misinterpretation</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">reads as a tacit admission that it&#39;s correct. But that in turn</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">encourages more; anyone who wants to pick a fight with you senses</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">that now is their chance.[18]</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">The worst thing about leaving YC was not working with Jessica</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">anymore. We&#39;d been working on YC almost the whole time we&#39;d known</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">each other, and we&#39;d neither tried nor wanted to separate it from</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">our personal lives, so leaving was like pulling up a deeply rooted</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">tree.[19]</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">One way to get more precise about the concept of invented vs</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">discovered is to talk about space aliens. Any sufficiently advanced</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">alien civilization would certainly know about the Pythagorean</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">theorem, for example. I believe, though with less certainty, that</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">they would also know about the Lisp in McCarthy&#39;s 1960 paper.But if so there&#39;s no reason to suppose that this is the limit of</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">the language that might be known to them. Presumably aliens need</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">numbers and errors and I/O too. So it seems likely there exists at</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">least one path out of McCarthy&#39;s Lisp along which discoveredness</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">is preserved.Thanks to Trevor Blackwell, John Collison, Patrick Collison, Daniel</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">Write a concise summary of the following:</span>


<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">&quot;The winter glory of the Sierra ! How little is known of it! Californians admire descriptions of the Swiss Alps, reading with breathless interest how ice and snow load their sublime heights, and booming avalanches sweep in glorious array through their crowded forests, while our own icy, snow-laden mountains, with their unrivaled forests, loom unnoticed along our eastern horizon. True, only mountaineers may penetrate their snow-blocked fastnesses to behold them in all their white wild grandeur, but to every healthy man and woman, and even to children, many of the subalpine valleys and lake-basins, six or seven thousand feet above the sea, remain invitingly open and approachable all winter. With a friend and his two little sons I have just returned from a week of bracing weathering around Lake Tahoe, in which we enjoyed glorious views of winter, fine rolling and sliding in the snow, swimming in the icy lake, and lusty reviving exercise on snow-shoes that kept our pulses dancing right merrily. All the weather was hearty and exhilarating, though varying almost from hour to hour: snowing, blowing, clear and cloudy, but never rigorously cold.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">This winter has been remarkably mild, the mercury having seldom made a very near approach to zero, even during the coldest nights around the lake, while the average noonday temperature was considerably above the freezing- point. The snow lies deep on the surrounding mountains and about the shores, solid white contrasting with the dark-blue water of the lake, while the forests and canons and the upper glacial fountain hollows are well filled, assuring abundance of summer water for the lakes and streams.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">According to the record kept by Mr. McKinney, on the west shore of the lake, eight miles above Tahoe City, at an elevation of 6,500 feet above sea-level, the amount of snow, measured as it fell, was twenty-two feet and four inches for the season up to March 20th, with four inches of rain, while an inch or two more of rain and two or three feet of snow will probably fall before the full opening of spring. Last season the snowfall, measured by the same observer, at the same station, was only nine feet and seven inches, while the season before last it was no less than forty seven feet and six inches. The fall about Yosemite Valley, according to my own observations, usually considerably exceeded this. The greater portion of the snow that loads the main summits of the range falls in small crisp flakes and broken crystals; or when accompanied by strong winds at a low temperature, the crystals, instead of being locked together in tufted flakes, are driven against each other and broken into meal and fine dust which darkens the sky like night But down in the forested region, at about the elevation of Lake Tahoe, the greater portion comes gently to the ground, light and feathery, some of the flakes in mild weather being nearly an inch in diameter, and is evenly distributed and kept from drifting to any great extent by Lake Tahoe in Winter. 121 the shelter of the woods. Every tree is loaded with the fairy bloom, bending down the branches, and hushing the singing of the elastic needles. When the storm is over and the sun shines, the dazzling snow at once begins to settle and shift and fall off the trees in miniature avalanches; then the relieved branches spring up and shake themselves dry, and the whole green forest, fed and refreshed, waves and sings again rejoicing. The snow on the ground settles also, and thaws and freezes until it becomes coarsely granulated ice, with all trace of its crystalline snow structure destroyed. This is the present condition of most of the snow on the range. From towards midnight until midday at this time of year a man may walk firmly over the surface, as if on ice, provided the preceding day has been warm and the night frosty.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">The forested region up to an elevation of about eight thousand feet is generally clear of snow towards the end of May or middle of June; but now (March 28th) the higher canons are still heavily blocked, and the head tributaries of the rivers flow in dark tunnels beneath the icy mass. As warm summer advances, the roof of compacted snow falls in here and there, leaving magnificent arching bridges where it is strongest, over which one may safely ride a horse. All the upper streams are thus buried and bridged every winter, and are seldom completely opened to the light before the end of June or middle of July.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">Notwithstanding twenty-two feet of snow has fallen here this season, so greatly has it been melted and compacted, the present average depth at a height of 7,500 feet does not exceed seven feet. The drifts in exposed lake hollows and along the lee sides of bald ridges above the timberline are often fifty feet or more in depth, and many of the latter are grandly adorned with overcurling cornices, beneath which pale blue light shimmers with ineffable beauty. But it is in the fountain cirques of the ancient glaciers, beneath the shadows of the highest peaks, that the heaviest and most enduring deposits are stored up. For there the lavish snowfall on the steep converging slopes is shot down in avalanches during or after&#39; every storm, heaping snow on snow to a depth of a hundred feet, or even more at times. These treasured banks are never wholly melted, however hot the summer, but with the few lingering glaciers form perennial fountains for the highest tributaries of the rivers.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">Few even among Californians have any fair conception of the marvelous abundance of glacier lakes hidden in the fastnesses of our mountains. The snow and some of the glaciers make a telling show, even from the distant lowlands; but not a single stream is visible, nor a hollow where one might hope to find a lake. Nevertheless, wild rivers are falling and sounding in every canon, and all their upper branches are fairly laden with lakes like orchard-trees with fruit. They nestle in rocky nooks and hollows about all the high peaks and in the larger canons, reflecting their stern, rugged beauty and giving charming animation to the bleakest and most forbidding landscapes. From the summit of Red Mountain, a day&#39;s journey to the east of Yosemite Valley, forty-two may be seen within a radius of eight or ten miles. The whole number in the Sierra can hardly be less than fifteen hundred, exclusive of the smaller gems, which are innumerable. Perhaps two-thirds of them lie on the west flank of the range, and all are restricted to the alpine and subalpine regions, those which once brightened the lower regions having long since vanished by the filling in of their basins. Lake Tahoe is king of them all, not only in size, but in the surpassing beauty of its shores and waters. It seems a kind of heaven to which the dead lakes of the lowlands had come with their best beauty spiritualized. It lies embosomed in mountains of moderate height near the northern extremity of the high portion of the Lake Tahoe in Winter. 123 range, between the main axis and a spur that puts out on the east side from near the head of the Carson River. Though it is twenty-one miles long by ten wide, and from about five hundred to sixteen hundred feet deep, its basin was once occupied by a glacier which filled it from the bottom to a point high above the present water-level, and being lavishly fed by the snows of the encompassing mountains, crawled slowly, like a mighty river, over the north rim of the basin, crushing and grinding the lower mountains that lay in its way, and it was only at the end of the ice period that this noble lake, at least in anything like its present form, came into existence.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">Excepting the forests that have sprung up around its shores, the post-glacial changes that have taken place are scarcely appreciable. The sediments carried forward by the inflowing streams at the head of the lake have made a few square miles of meadow-land, and the breaking through of a moraine dam in the canon of the outlet has lowered the lake considerably, leaving shore benches and lines on the rocky promontories to mark the original level. With these comparatively unimportant exceptions, the lake itself and all its grandly sculptured, ice-scored, and moraine-streaked basin exist to-day in just about the condition they presented when first they came to the light towards the close of the Glacial Period.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">The destructive action of man in clearing away the forests has not as yet effected any very marked change in general views. Perhaps about 150,000,000 feet of lumber for the Comstock mines has thus far been cut from the lake shores. But the business is being pushed so fervently from year to year, almost the entire basin must be stripped ere long of one of its most attractive features. One of the lumber companies at work here has contracted with mine owners to supply 36,000,000 feet of lumber and 60,000 cords of wood this season. It is estimated that the Tahoe basin still contains about 600,000,000 feet of lumber available for the mines.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">In summer the woods resound with the outlandish noise of loggers and choppers and screaming mills; skiffs and steamboats skim the lovely blue water in work and play; and ever and anon as you thread the groves along shore you come upon groups of gay tourists sauntering about, gathering flowers, or resting luxuriously in the rosiny shade of the pines, some in easy picnic attire, others all ribbons and colors, glaring wildly amid the green leaves and frightening the wondering squirrels and birds. But winter brings rest. At sight of the first snowflake pleasure-seekers flee as from a plague, the ax leaves the woods, and the kind snow heals every scar. Contemplating the basin from any commanding hilltop, only pale curls of smoke seen at wide intervals betoken the existence of human dwellings. Like the bears, the few settlers that remain here are silently &quot;holed up.&quot; The snow covers their cabins as if they were bowlders, and when approached only a narrow shoveled-out passage, or tunnel, is found leading to the door. Some of the more enterprising winter dwellers drift about in boats in calm weather, catching trout for the Carson market,â€”for the lake, on account of its great depth, never freezes. They thus earn from thirty to forty dollars a month, and at the same time get rid of lonely dullness. A trapper may also be seen now and then shuffling along the shore on long Norwegian snow-shoes in pursuit of minks, fishers, and otters.</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">In this letter I intended only to say a good word for winter in the mountains, hoping to incite others to come and enjoy it, sketching our excursion to illustrate the ease and comfort with which such snowy winter rambles may be made; but I have written too much I fear about the snow to leave room for more than a thin outline. We went by rail to Lake Tahoe in Winter. 125 Carson, and from there set out by stage for Glenbrook. After ascending on wheels until we reached the snow-line, the driver attached his four horses to a sled, hoping thus to cross the summit, which is less than eight thousand feet high, without much difficulty. But mild weather had softened the snow, and the unfortunate animals, after floundering and wallowing through a mile of it, lay down exhausted with their heels in the air. Then we made our way on foot over to the lake. Next day, on a small steam-tug, we crossed the lake to McKinney&#39;s, on the west shore, where we were at home. Here we spent a few health-giving, delightful days, rowing, bathing, racing at lightning speed on snow-shoes down a mountain-side back of the house, and slipping about through the solemn, silent woods. Only the eldest of my companions ventured with me on the steep slopes. This was his first experience on snowshoes, and the several descents he made were the most remarkable specimens of falling locomotion that I ever had the fortune to witness. In shooting down steep declivities the long sled-runner-like shoes have to be kept parallel with firmly braced limbs. My friend, however, heedless of advice, launched himself in wild abandon, bouncing and diving, his limbs and shoes in chaotic entanglement, now in the snow, now in the air, whirling over and over in giddy rolls and somersaults that would shame the most extravagant performances of a circus acrobat. How original and inimitable he was! Wonderfully refreshing and exhilarating his queer capers must have been; for on coming to rest, with his runaway members divorced and lost, he would quietly gather himself, pick out the snow from his neck and ears, and say with preternatural solemnity, &quot;This, Muir, is the very poetry of motion.&quot;</span>

<span class=" -Color -Color-Bold -Color-Bold-Green">We also spent some rare evenings by the huge fire in McKinney&#39;s old cabin. The log walls are covered with trophies of the chase, for our host has been a great hunter in his day. Two live pet coons were frolicking on the floor while our grand old host smiled benignly and played with them, the firelight gleaming on his weathered face. How big he seems, thus brought into relief, and what a shadow he casts! The fragrant rosiny fire is the very god of the home. No wonder the old nations, with their fresher instincts, had their fireside gods. At last, when a mild snow-storm was blowing, we rowed to the lower end of the lake and completed our excursion by slipping on snow-shoes down the Truckee canon to the railroad.&quot;</span>
