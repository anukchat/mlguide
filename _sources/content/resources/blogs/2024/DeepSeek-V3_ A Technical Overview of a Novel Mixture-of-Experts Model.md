# DeepSeek-V3: A Technical Overview of a Novel Mixture-of-Experts Model

DeepSeek-V3 emerges as a significant advancement in the field of large language models (LLMs). This model, detailed in the accompanying technical report, <mark>employs a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture</mark>, a design choice that allows for both high performance and computational efficiency. The architecture is composed of a number of expert sub-networks, which are activated conditionally based on the input, enabling the model to scale effectively. The training process involved a large corpus of text and code data, leveraging a combination of supervised learning and reinforcement learning techniques. <mark>DeepSeek-V3 demonstrates strong performance across a range of benchmarks</mark>, while maintaining a focus on efficient inference. The model is available on GitHub, providing access to both the model weights and the technical documentation.


## Architectural Innovations and Training Efficiency

DeepSeek-V3 builds upon the efficient architecture of DeepSeek-V2, incorporating several key innovations to enhance performance and training efficiency. The model utilizes a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with 671 billion total parameters, of which 37 billion are activated for each token. This design allows for a large model capacity while maintaining computational efficiency during inference.

<mark>A core component of DeepSeek-V3 is the Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) mechanism.</mark> This attention mechanism, thoroughly validated in DeepSeek-V2, contributes to the model's ability to process information effectively. The DeepSeekMoE architecture, also inherited from DeepSeek-V2, further optimizes the model's performance by enabling efficient routing of tokens to different experts.

A significant innovation in DeepSeek-V3 is the introduction of an <mark>auxiliary-loss-free strategy for load balancing.</mark> Traditional load balancing techniques often involve auxiliary losses that can negatively impact model performance. DeepSeek-V3's approach mitigates this issue by achieving effective load balancing without the performance degradation associated with auxiliary losses. This is a crucial step toward optimizing the MoE architecture for maximum efficiency.

Furthermore, DeepSeek-V3 employs a Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) objective during training. This objective has been shown to improve model performance and can also be used for speculative decoding, potentially accelerating inference.

<mark>The pre-training of DeepSeek-V3 leverages an FP8 mixed precision training framework.</mark> This is the first validation of FP8 training on an extremely large-scale model, demonstrating its feasibility and effectiveness. The use of FP8 significantly reduces memory requirements and computational costs, enabling the training of larger models with fewer resources.

To overcome communication bottlenecks in cross-node MoE training, DeepSeek-V3 employs a co-design approach involving algorithms, frameworks, and hardware. <mark>This approach achieves near full computation-communication overlap, significantly improving training efficiency and reducing training costs.</mark> This allows for scaling up the model size without incurring additional overhead.

The pre-training of DeepSeek-V3 was completed on 14.8 trillion tokens using only 2.664 million H800 GPU hours. This cost-effective training process resulted in a strong open-source base model. The subsequent fine-tuning stages required only 0.1 million GPU hours, further highlighting the efficiency of the training process.

The model's architecture and training methodology are designed for stability. Throughout the entire training process, no irrecoverable loss spikes or rollbacks were experienced.

```
cd inference
python fp8_cast_bf16.py --input-fp8-hf-path /path/to/fp8_weights --output-bf16-hf-path /path/to/bf16_weights
```
The provided code snippet demonstrates how to convert FP8 weights to BF16, which is useful for experimentation.


## Post-Training and Performance Benchmarks

### Post-Training: Knowledge Distillation from DeepSeek-R1

We employ an innovative methodology to distill reasoning capabilities from a long-Chain-of-Thought (CoT) model, specifically from one of the DeepSeek R1 series models, into standard Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly DeepSeek-V3. Our pipeline incorporates the verification and reflection patterns of R1 into DeepSeek-V3, which notably improves its reasoning performance. Furthermore, we maintain control over the output style and length of DeepSeek-V3.
