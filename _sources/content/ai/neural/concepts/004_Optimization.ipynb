If you plot the old definition of J (no regularization) then you might not see it decrease monotonically.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Understanding Dropout\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dropout randomly knocks out units in your network. So it's as if on every iteration you're working with a smaller NN, and so using a smaller NN seems like it should have a regularizing effect.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Another intuition: can't rely on any one feature, so have to spread out weights.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- It's possible to show that dropout has a similar effect to L2 regularization.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Dropout can have different `keep_prob` per layer.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- The input layer dropout has to be near 1 (or 1 - no dropout) because you don't want to eliminate a lot of features.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- If you're more worried about some layers overfitting than others, you can set a lower `keep_prob` for some layers than others. The downside is, this gives you even more hyperparameters to search for using cross-validation. One other alternative might be to have some layers where you apply dropout and some layers where you don't apply dropout and then just have one hyperparameter, which is a `keep_prob` for the layers for which you do apply dropouts.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- A lot of researchers are using dropout with Computer Vision (CV) because they have a very big input size and almost never have enough data, so overfitting is the usual problem. And dropout is a regularization technique to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- A downside of dropout is that the cost function J is not well defined and it will be hard to debug (plot J by iteration).\n",
    "  (To solve that you'll need to turn off dropout, set all the `keep_prob`s to 1, and then run the code and check that it monotonically decreases J and then turn on the dropouts again.)\n",

    "\n",
    "**What is L2-regularization actually doing?**:   \n",
    "  - L2-regularization relies on the assumption that a model with small weights is simpler than a model with large weights. Thus, by penalizing the square values of the weights in the cost function you drive all the weights to smaller values. It becomes too costly for the cost to have large weights! This leads to a smoother model in which the output changes more slowly as the input changes.\n",

For example, if `keep_prob` is 0.5, then we will on average shut down half the nodes, so the output will be scaled by 0.5 since only the remaining half are contributing to the solution. Dividing by 0.5 is equivalent to multiplying by 2. Hence, the output now has the same expected value. You can check that this works even when keep_prob is other values than 0.5.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Batch normalization does some regularization:\n",
    "  - Each mini batch is scaled by the mean/variance computed of that mini-batch.\n",
    "  - This adds some noise to the values $Z[l]$ within that mini batch. So similar to dropout it adds some noise to each hidden layer's activations.\n",
    "  - This has a slight regularization effect.\n",
    "  - Using bigger size of the mini-batch you are reducing noise and therefore regularization effect.\n",
    "  - Don't rely on batch normalization as a regularization. It's intended for normalization of hidden units, activations and therefore speeding up learning. For regularization use other regularization techniques (L2 or dropout).\n",

    "\n",
    "- When we train a NN with Batch normalization, we compute the mean and the variance of the mini-batch.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In testing we might need to process examples one at a time. The mean and the variance of one example won't make sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We have to compute an estimated value of mean and variance to use it in testing time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We can use the weighted average across the mini-batches.\n",

    "- We will use the estimated values of the mean and variance to test.\n",
