# Generative AI

Generative AI is artificial intelligence capable of <mark>generating text, images and other types of content </mark>. 

What makes it a fantastic technology is that it democratizes AI, <mark>anyone can use it with as little as a text prompt. A sentence written in a natural language.</mark> 

There's no need for you to learn a language like Java or SQL to accomplish something worthwhile, <mark>all you need is to use your language, state what you want and out comes a suggestion from an AI model</mark>.

The applications and impact for this is huge, you write or understand reports, write applications and much more, all in seconds.

### What led to rapid evolution of generative AI ?

üëâ **<mark>Advances in computing power</mark>**, including the development of GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) and specialized hardware like TPUs (Tensor Processing Units), have enabled the training of large-scale generative models more efficiently.

üëâ The proliferation of the internet and digital data has provided **<mark>vast amounts of training data for AI systems</mark>**. This allows generative models to learn and produce more accurate outputs.

üëâ **<mark>Continuous improvements in generative AI algorithms</mark>** and training techniques have played a significant role. Techniques such as attention mechanisms, self-attention, and reinforcement learning have contributed to the effectiveness of generative models.

Advances in natural language processing research have been crucial for text generation tasks.
