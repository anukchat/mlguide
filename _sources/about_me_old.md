  ## My Journey

  My curiosity to know how things work has made me a passionate learner, which has steered me to take various job roles in my career (by force or by interest).

  I started my career 10 years back with no other career option but to be a technical support person. My only job was to open some webpages at 8.00 AM and validate if they are green before the stock market opens.

  I couldn't sustain that for long, so I didn't go to the job one day.

  With a fear of losing the only job and no other choice in hand, I settled to become a non-tech support person (my only job was to sort and filter Excel columns). I happily did this for one year.

  Then again, with fewer arranged options in hand, I became an AS-400 developer (a smaller version of Mainframe, a black screen nightmare), which didn't go well too.

  In between various roles I took, most of the time I was tricked into technical support roles which I never wanted. It was easy to get into them but very difficult to get out.

  But situations make you rebellious, only if you know what you want for yourself.

  I joined a project again as a non-technical data analyst role, but that changed the course of my career. I was working in a team automating the labor-intensive support tasks of checking the webpages every day at 8.00 AM, and I was responsible for analyzing the various sources in Excel.

  I completed that analysis in a week's time, but then my curiosity kicked in, and I learned web scraping with C#, using Selenium and other libraries. I worked on creating a multi-threaded .NET application with a scheduler, which would invoke multiple Selenium scripts at once at exactly 8.00 AM and would validate the support checks automatically.

  That application ended up giving a BIG contract from a BIG bank to our company.

  That made me realize how learning new things and implementing them can give big results.

  From that day onwards, I joined many companies, with lots of ups and downs and similar types of challenges in my path. A lot got changed, but one thing that never changed for me is curiosity and eagerness to learn and build new things for myself.

  That eagerness took me to the learning path of Machine Learning. I took numerous courses and specializations from Coursera, watched Stanford lectures on Computer Vision/NLP/Mathematics and a lot more, researched and read many books, participated in Kaggle/MachineHack competitions, took a lot of notes, and worked on various projects. Many of them were/are to satisfy my curiosity and eagerness to know "How something works!"

  That eagerness is still driving me to keep learning and enjoy the process rather than waiting for the end.

  From a technical support person, AS-400 developer (a black screen), non-tech data analyst, test automation engineer, data engineer, to an ML developer, I can echo my story with a lot of other people who had similar experiences.

  ## Why this website?

  During my learning process, I found we have enormous amounts of information available for absorption, but they all are scattered. Learning something new is easy, but to remember what you learnt is a VERY DIFFICULT TASK.

  So, I started finding different ways to remember learnt things for long and then I devised a playbook which, if followed diligently, can help remember the concepts for a very long time.

  I have a habit of taking notes while learning something new, which I can later use to quickly go through and revise the concepts I learnt. This became a standard for any topic I learnt/read on.

  This website is an effort to compile all those notes and resources (specifically for learning AI/ML) and put them into executable Jupyter notebooks, organized into different logical sections (these notes act as learning pointers and a one-stop place for revising the concepts).

  These Jupyter notebooks can be executed within the website itself using Binder without making you leave the website or setting up a separate configuration (just click on the rocket icon and select Live code, it will take some time to get the environment ready).

  Some of these Jupyter notebooks are resource-intensive, so you might have to run them in a Google Colab environment (you need to install the requirements.txt separately in the Colab environment and also import the dataset).

  One of my favorite Dr. Richard Feynman, a theoretical physicist and a Nobel laureate, has a simple yet powerful technique for learning any topic.

  My website is an effort to follow that. If you find any mistake or doubts or any new topics that need to be added, don't forget to message me.
