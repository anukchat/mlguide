                                <p>My curiosity to know how things work has made me a passionate learner, which has
                                    steered me to take various job roles in my career (by force or by interest).</p>
                                <p>I started my career 10 years back with no other career option but to be a technical
                                    support person. My only job was to open some webpages at 8.00 AM and validate if
                                    they are green before the stock market opens.</p>
                                <p>I couldn't sustain that for long, so I didn't go to the job one day.</p>
                                <p>With a fear of losing the only job and no other choice in hand, I settled to become a
                                    non-tech support person (my only job was to sort and filter Excel columns), which I
                                    happily did for 1 year.</p>
                                <p>Then again with fewer arranged options in hand, I became an AS-400 developer (smaller
                                    version of Mainframe, a black screen nightmare), that didn't go well too.</p>
                                <p>In between various roles I took, most of the times I was tricked into technical
                                    support roles which I never wanted. It was easy to get into them but very difficult
                                    to get out.</p>
                                <p>But situations make you rebellious, only if you know what you want for yourself.</p>
                                <p>I joined a project again as a non-technical data analyst role, but that changed the
                                    course of my career. I was working in a team who were automating the
                                    labour-intensive support tasks of checking the webpages every day at 8.00 AM and I
                                    was responsible for analyzing the various sources in Excel.</p>
                                <p>I completed that analysis in a week's time, but then my curiosity kicked in and I
                                    learnt web scraping with C#, using Selenium and other libraries. I worked on
                                    creating a multi-threaded .Net application with a scheduler, which would invoke
                                    multiple Selenium scripts at once at exactly 8.00 AM and would validate the support
                                    checks automatically.</p>
                                <p>That application ended up giving a BIG contract from a BIG bank to our company.</p>
                                <p>That made me realize how learning new things and implementing them can give big
                                    results.</p>
                                <p>From that day onwards, I joined many companies, with lots of ups and downs and
                                    similar types of challenges in my path. A lot got changed but one thing that never
                                    changed for me is curiosity and eagerness to learn and build new things for myself.
                                </p>
                                <p>That eagerness took me to the learning path of Machine Learning. I took numerous
                                    courses and specializations from Coursera, watched Stanford lectures on computer
                                    vision, NLP, mathematics and a lot more, researched and read many books,
                                    participated in Kaggle/MachineHack competitions, took a lot of notes and worked on
                                    various projects. Many of them were/are to satisfy my curiosity and eagerness to
                                    know "How something works!"</p>
                                <p>That eagerness is still driving me to keep learning and enjoy the process rather than
                                    waiting for the end.</p>
                                <p>From a technical support person, AS-400 developer (a black screen), non-tech data
                                    analyst, test automation engineer, data engineer, to an ML developer. I can echo my
                                    story with a lot of other people who had similar experiences.</p>

                                <h5>Why this website?</h5>
                                <p>During my learning process, I found we have enormous amounts of information available
                                    for absorption, but they all are scattered...</p>
                                <p>Learning something new is easy but to remember what you learnt is a VERY DIFFICULT
                                    TASK.</p>
                                <p>So, I started finding different ways to remember learnt things for long and then I
                                    devised a playbook which if followed diligently, can help remember the concepts for
                                    a very long time.</p>
                                <p>I have a habit of taking notes while learning something new, which I can later use to
                                    quickly go through and revise the concepts I learnt. This became a standard for any
                                    topic I learnt/read on.</p>
                                <p>This website is an effort to compile all those notes and resources (specifically for
                                    learning AI/ML) and put them into executable Jupyter notebooks, organized into
                                    different logical sections (These notes act as learning pointers and a one-stop
                                    place for revising the concepts).</p>
                                <p>These Jupyter notebooks can be executed within the website itself using Binder
                                    without making you leave the website or setting up separate configuration (Just
                                    click on the rocket icon and select Live code, it will take some time to get the
                                    environment ready).</p>
                                <p>Some of these Jupyter notebooks are resource-intensive, so you might have to run them
                                    in a Google Colab environment (You need to install the requirements.txt separately
                                    in the Colab environment and also import the dataset).</p>
                                <p>One of my favourites, Dr. Richard Feynman, a theoretical physicist and a Nobel
                                    laureate, has a simple yet powerful technique for learning any topic.</p>
                                <p>My website is an effort to follow that. If you find any mistakes or doubts or any new
                                    topics that need to be added, don't forget to message me.</p>
